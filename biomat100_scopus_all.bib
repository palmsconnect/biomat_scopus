	abstract = {Light-based hydrogel crosslinking is a new approach in rapid and high-resolution 3D printing; however, using this method in tissue engineering is challenging due to the toxicity of photoinitiators, their solvents, and their low efficiency. Herein, a novel, water-soluble photoinitiator with high efficiency in light-based 3D printing is introduced. Low-cost photoinitator, 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphenyl phosphinate, is converted into nanoparticles via a microemulsion method and dispersed in water. Cell toxicity assays were performed to prove that these nanoparticles are non-toxic and can be used in biomedical applications. Finally, the nanoparticles were utilized in the high-accuracy 3D printing of hydrogels. The results of this study indicate that these particles are potent to be used in bioprinting. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Bioplastics are made from starch that can be decomposed naturally to be an alternative to commercial plastics. The research objective was to know the effect of the composition of mangrove powder and glycerol on the characteristics of the synthesized bioplastics. This study also obtained the maximum composition of bioplastics made from mangrove powder by adding glycerol and chitosan. In this study, bioplastics were synthesized using starch as an optimizer of the mechanical properties of bioplastics, chitosan as reinforcement and water repellent, and glycerol as a plasticizer. The results of bioplastics were characterized by mechanical properties (tensile strength and elongation), hydrophobility, biodegradation, and functional groups. Based on the study's results, the optimum composition of bioplastics was found, namely mangrove 2 grams and glycerol 0.9 ml, with a tensile strength value of 1,600 MPa, 67.9% elongation, 34.75% hydrophobility, and 39.98% biodegradation. The main functional groups of bioplastics were shown through the results of FTIR analysis, such as NH (3294.58 cm-1), CH (2883.58 cm-1), OH (2129.41 cm-1), and CO (1755.22 cm-1). © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Objective: Nano-hydroxyapatite and its composites(nHA) have been widely used as grafts in inter-vertebral fusion. However, the safety and efficacy of the graft in inter-vertebral fusion is controversial. This meta-analysis aimed at evaluating the safety and efficacy of nHA and non-hydroxyapatite grafts (noHA) (autologous bone, etc.) in inter-body fusion. Materials and methods: A comprehensive search was performed in electronic database as follows: PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI) from inception until October 2022. Clinical studies on the effect of nHA and noHA in spinal fusion were collected. Analysis of outcome indicators using RevMan 5.4 statistical software. Results: The meta-analysis showed that the operation time of patients who underwent inter-body fusion with nHA grafts was less than that of patients who underwent noHA (p < 0.05). Compared with the noHA group, the nHA group can achieve similar clinical effects in the fusion rate(OR = 1.29,95%CI: 0.88 to 1.88,p = 0.19),Subsidence rate(OR = 1.2,95%CI:0.44 to 3.28,p = 0.72), inter-vertebral space height(SMD = 0.04,95%CI:-0.08 to 0.15,p = 0.54),Cobb angle(SMD = 0.21,95%CI: 0.18 to 0.6,p = 0.21),Blood loss(SMD = -36.58,95%CI: -81.45 to 8.29,p = 0.11),operative time in 12 months(SMD = -5.82,95%CI: -9.98 to -1.67,p = 0.006) and in the final follow-up(SMD = -0.38,95%CI: -0.51 to -0.26,p < 0.00001),ODI(SMD = 0.68,95%CI: -0.84 to 2.19,p = 0.38), VAS(SMD = 0.17,95%CI: -0.13 to 0.48,p = 0.27) and adverse events(OR = 0.98,95%CI: 0.66 to 1.45,p = 0.92), and the differences are not statistically significant. Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests that nHA matrix grafts are similar to noHA grafts in the safety and efficacy of spinal reconstruction, and are an ideal material for inter-vertebral bone grafting. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The immersion test in simulated body fluid (SBF) is the most commonly utilized in vitro test to reflect an implant's corrosion behavior. Ironically, the influences of the alloying elements on the corrosion behavior were usually concealed by the protective corrosion deposits formed by the specific inorganic species in the SBF. In this study, the effects of the alloying elements on the corrosion behavior of commercially pure magnesium (CP Mg) and Mg-1.0Ca-0.5Sr alloy were determined using 0.9 wt.% NaCl as the corrosion media due to its minor influence on corrosion precipitation and similar osmolality to blood plasma. Their corrosion profile was analyzed using surface characterization techniques and immersion tests, including; (i) hydrogen evolution test (H2), (ii) pH trend, and (iii) weight loss measurement. With the aim of simulating the pH control of the physiological homeostatic process, a pH-buffered pseudo physiological solution was achieved via two techniques; (i) a 24-hour corrosion media renewal routine and through the use of (ii) TRIS-HCL buffer reagent. It is shown that Mg-1.0Ca-0.5Sr alloy exhibits a superior corrosion resistance in both pH regulating treatments, while the effects of the alloying were evident through the corrosion media renewal routine. © 2023 by the authors.

	abstract = {The biodegradation behavior and mechanical properties of Mg-Sr-Y alloys were systematically investigated for the medical application. The alloy (Mg-0.3Sr-0.5Y) exhibits a comparable UTS as 111.53 MPa and shows a general uniform degradation behavior with low corrosion rate as only 0.823 mm y−1 in Hanks’ solution. The simultaneous solid solution of Y in α-Mg phase and in Mg17Sr2 phase reduces the micro-galvanic corrosion. Additionally, the formation of a compact composite film of Mg(OH)2, Y2O3 and Sr-substituted phosphate (Sr-HA) delivers the protection for the matrix. Low corrosion rate, fine precipitates and dispersed Y rich-zones, which hinder the corrosion propagation, further guarantees a uniform degradation behavior. While, with increasing Sr content, the corrosion resistance is deteriorated because of the formed continuous distribution of Mg17Sr2 along grain boundaries. By tailoring composition and structure, Mg-Sr-Y alloys with balanced mechanical and bio-degradation properties can be promising for the bio-applications. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Periodontitis, an infectious and common disease worldwide, leads to the destruction of the periodontal ligament-alveolar bone complex. Within the bone metabolic niche, communication between periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) has been considered a major contributor to osteogenesis. PDLSC-derived extracellular vesicles (P-EVs) have shown great potential for bone regeneration. However, the secretion and uptake mechanisms of P-EVs remain elusive. Herein, the biogenesis of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from PDLSCs was observed using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. PDLSCs were transduced with Ras-associated protein 27a (Rab27a) siRNA (PDLSCsiRab27a) to inhibit EV secretion. The effect of P-EVs on BMMSCs was evaluated using a non-contact transwell co-culture system. We observed that Rab27a knockdown decreased EV secretion, and PDLSCsiRab27a remarkably attenuated co-culture-enhanced osteogenesis of BMMSCs. Isolated PDLSC-derived EVs enhanced osteogenic differentiation of BMMSCs in vitro and induced bone regeneration in a calvarial defect model in vivo. PDLSC-derived EVs were rapidly endocytosed by BMMSCs via the lipid raft/cholesterol endocytosis pathway and triggered the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. In conclusion, PDLSCs contribute to the osteogenesis of BMMSCs through Rab27a-mediated EV secretion, thereby providing a potential cell-free approach for bone regeneration. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {3-Hydroxybutyrate (3HB) is a small ketone body molecule produced endogenously by the body in the liver. Previous studies have shown that 3HB can reduce blood glucose level in type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients. However, there is no systematic study and clear mechanism to evaluate and explain the hypoglycemic effect of 3HB. Here we demonstrate that 3HB reduces fasting blood glucose level, improves glucose tolerance, and ameliorates insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic mice through hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2). Mechanistically, 3HB increases intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+) levels by activating HCAR2, thereby stimulating adenylate cyclase (AC) to increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentration, and then activating protein kinase A (PKA). Activated PKA inhibits Raf1 proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase (Raf1) activity, resulting in a decrease in extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) activity and ultimately inhibiting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) Ser273 phosphorylation in adipocytes. Inhibition of PPARγ Ser273 phosphorylation by 3HB altered the expression of PPARγ regulated genes and reduced insulin resistance. Collectively, 3HB ameliorates insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic mice through a pathway of HCAR2/Ca2+/cAMP/PKA/Raf1/ERK1/2/PPARγ. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Mushroom lactases are a hopeful biocatalyst for the synthesis and modification of different compounds. They are an accessible and inexpensive enzyme for the preparation of reaction objects and have recently received attention. Laccase purification was performed from basidiomycete Lentinus strigosus (LS) in several stages: Stage 1. On ion-exchange chromatography on TEAE Servacell 23 (400 ml), two distinctly separated laccase activity peaks were observed, eluted from the carrier at 0.21 and 0.27 M NaCl. In order to reduce the loss of enzymes, all fractions with laccase activity were collected, concentrated, and desalted using an ultrafiltration cell (Amicon, United States) with a UM-10 membrane. Stage 2. The resulting preparation with laccase activity was applied to a Q-Sepharose column (60 ml). Two well-separated peaks with laccase activity were obtained during the elution: laccase I (0.12 M NaCl) and laccase II (0.2 M NaCl). Stage 3. In the course of further purification of both enzymes, carried out on anion-exchange carrier Resource Q (6 ml), a broken gradient was used: 0-10%, 10-20%, and 20-100% with 1M NaCl. Stage 4. Both laccase I and laccase II, obtained after Resource Q, were desalted, concentrated to 1 ml each, and applied to a Superdex 75 gel filtration column. As a result, two laccases were obtained in a homogeneous form. © 2024, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The current ageing trend of the world population has, in part, accounted for Alzheimer disease (AD) being a public health issue in recent times. Although some progress has been made in clarifying AD-related pathophysiological mechanisms, effective intervention is still elusive. Biometals are indispensable to normal physiological functions of the human body—for example, neurogenesis and metabolism. However, their association with AD remains highly controversial. Copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) are biometals that have been investigated at great length in relation to neurodegeneration, whereas less attention has been afforded to other trace biometals, such as molybdenum (Mo), and iodine. Given the above context, we reviewed the limited number of studies that have evidenced various effects following the usage of these two biometals in different investigative models of AD. Revisiting these biometals via thorough investigations, along with their biological mechanisms may present a solid foundation for not only the development of effective interventions, but also as diagnostic agents for AD. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of a closed-cell self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) with or without expanded-polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE)-covering membrane in a porcine iliac artery model. Twelve Yorkshire domestic pigs were divided into a bare closed-cell SEMS (B-SEMS) group (n = 6) and covered closed-cell SEMS (C-SEMS) group (n = 6). Both closed-cell SEMSs were placed in the right or left iliac artery. Thrombogenicity score in the C-SEMS group was significantly higher than that in the B-SEMS group (p = 0.004) after 4 weeks. Angiographic findings of mean luminal diameters at 4 weeks follow-up did not differ significantly between B-SEMS and C-SEMS groups. Neointimal hyperplasia thickness as well as degree of inflammatory cell infiltration and collagen deposition in the C-SEMS group was significantly greater than that in the B-SEMS group (p < 0.001). Closed-cell SEMSs successfully maintained patency for 4 weeks without stent-related complications in the porcine iliac artery. Although mild thrombus with neointimal hyperplasia was observed in the C-SEMS group, subsequent occlusion, and in-stent stenosis did not occur in any of the pigs until the end of the study. Closed-cell SEMS with or without the e-PTFE covering membrane is effective and safe for the porcine iliac artery. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Claudin-4 (CLDN4), a tight junction protein, is overexpressed in several types of cancer, and is considered a biomarker for cancer-targeted treatment. CLDN4 is not exposed in normal cells, but becomes accessible in cancer cells, in which tight junctions are weakened. Notably, surface-exposed CLDN4 has recently been found to act as a receptor for Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) and fragment of CPE (CPE17) that binds to the second domain of CLDN4. Methods: Here, we sought to develop a CPE17-containing liposome that targets pancreatic cancers through binding to exposed CLDN4. Results: Doxorubicin (Dox)-loaded, CPE17-conjugated liposomes (D@C-LPs) preferentially targeted CLDN4-expressing cell lines, as evidenced by greater uptake and cytotoxicity compared with CLDN4-negative cell lines, whereas uptake and cytotoxicity of Dox-loaded liposomes lacking CPE17 (D@LPs) was similar for both CLDN4-positive and negative cell lines. Notably, D@C-LPs showed greater accumulation in targeted pancreatic tumor tissues compared with normal pancreas tissue; in contrast, Dox-loaded liposomes lacking CPE17 (D@LPs) showed little accumulation in pancreatic tumor tissues. Consistent with this, D@C-LPs showed greater anticancer efficacy compared with other liposome formulations and significantly extended survival. Conclusions: We expect our findings will aid in the prevention and treatment of pancreatic cancer and provide a framework for identifying cancer-specific strategies that target exposed receptors.

	abstract = {Background: Xerostomia (dryness of the mouth) is one of the most common long-term consequences of ageing, and it causes a tremendous impact on the function and morphology of the salivary ductal system. As a consequence, it leads to a decrease in the amount of salivary output and also affects the overall quality of life. The purpose of this study was to determine whether electrostimulation using a custom designed transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) device will help to improve the quality of secreted saliva following electrostimulation. Methods: One hundred thirty-five participants underwent the intervention for three months, twice daily (80 Hz). Pre-intervention and post-intervention unstimulated saliva were collected. Parameters such as salivary pH, cortisol level, salivary antioxidants, total protein, the viscosity of saliva, and microbial carriage were analysed. Results: Salivary pH, cortisol, microbial cultures, viscosity, and antioxidants showed a significant difference at the end of the 3rd month (p < 0.05). Irrespective of the patient's age, gender, and common underlying systemic illnesses (diabetes and hypertension), a significant change in the quality of the salivary analytes was observed. Conclusion: The study emphasises the use of a custom designed TENS device in improving the quality of secreted saliva among old patients with oral dryness. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Light-based 3D bioprinting is now employed widely to fabricate geometrically complex constructs for various biomedical applications. However, the inherent light scattering defect creates significant challenges in patterning dilute hydrogels to form high-fidelity structures with fine-scale features. Herein, we introduce a photoinhibiting approach that can effectively suppress the light scattering effect via a mechanism of simultaneous photoabsorption and free-radical reaction. This biocompatible approach significantly improves the printing resolution (~1.2 - ~2.1 pixels depending on swelling) and shape fidelity (geometric error less than 5%), while minimising the costly trial-and-error procedures. The capability in patterning 3D complex constructs using different hydrogels is demonstrated by manufacturing various scaffolds featuring intricate multi-sized channels and thin-walled networks. Importantly, cellularised gyroid scaffolds (HepG2) are fabricated successfully, exhibiting high cell proliferation and functionality. The strategy established in this study promotes the printability and operability of light-based 3D bioprinting systems, allowing numerous new applications for tissue engineering. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Even though rigorous multi-modal treatment, the overall survival after diagnosis is reported to be less than 15 months, the surgical excision of the tumor, observed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, is a widely utilized treatment strategy for GB. However, contemporary advances exhibit that exosomes, dendrimers, liposomes, and certain metallic nanoparticles in the form of prodrugs advance the infiltration of the drugs into the blood-brain barriers, consequently contributing to novel chances of combating the GB confrontation with chemotherapeutics. The Food and Drug Administration of the United States (FDA) has accepted numerous medications, and significant initiatives have been adopted for advanced novel chemotherapeutic agents for GB.

Ethanol extract of the husks (CWPE) was assessed as a corrosion inhibitor for X80 steel in 1 M HCl at 303 – 333 K under static weight loss and electrochemical conditions, accompanied by functional group (FTIR) and surface morphological (SEM) analyses. The inhibition efficiency of 94.6 % and 85.2 % were obtained at 303 and 333 K. CWPE acts as a mixed type corrosion inhibitor with a major influence on the anodic half-reaction and increases charge transfer resistance while decreasing double-layer capacitance and corrosion current density. Corrosion inhibition is attributed to spontaneous adsorption of CWPE phytocompounds on X80 steel surface best approximated by the Langmuir adsorption model. Adsorption is enabled mainly by O, N, and C=C sites affording surface protection and reduced pitting as observed by SEM.

With an optimally selected testing protocol, it will be possible to image cell lines using MRI at the cellular level and then implement pharmaceutical substances into ba-days and test their effectiveness in cell cultures. Preliminary studies on pharmaceutical substances show that the application of MRI for in vitro experimental studies yields satisfactory differences in signal intensity, so it turns out to be important to implement in vitro studies and then try to transfer them to in vivo studies. Trastuzumab is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds selectively to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. It is used to treat breast cancer in patients whose tumors overexpress the Her-2 receptor. The implementation of cell culture research is helping to understand cell biology. Pharmaceutical research using 3D cell culture provides biologically relevant models for determining drug activity in tumor tissue, which can contribute to assessing response to therapies and improving drug resistance. Attempts to use MR relaxation times measured in cancer cell cultures help assess the biological changes of the applied drug therapy. Relating the results of relaxation times to the results of abundance and viability will allow assessment of the effect of Trastuzumab on viability in cell cultures without interference. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Here, we provide fundamental insights on the atomic Arsenic (As) adsorption on the cellulose biopolymer using first-principles density functional theory. The findings indicate that the adsorption process is exothermic in nature, where the As can spontaneously adsorb on different sites of cellulose. The calculated binding energy shows that the As strongly interacts with the hydroxyl and hydroxymethyl group of the cellulose and is minimal on the cellulose's backbone. In all studied configurations, As gained an electronic charge in all four reactive sites and revealed the localization of electrons in the interface of As and cellulose. The electronic band structure shows that the impurity states of the As appear near the Fermi level, thus lowering the bandgap of the cellulose-As systems. Further, the optical absorption spectra of cellulose-As systems revealed new peaks at the visible region. These results suggest cellulose biopolymer can be used as an adsorbent and sensing material for As. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: The underlying mechanism of Parkinson’s disease are still unidentified, but excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation are considered key actors. Proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) are transcription factors involved in the control of numerous pathways. Specifically, PPARβ/δ is recognized as an oxidative stress sensor, and we have previously reported that it plays a detrimental role in neurodegeneration. Methods: Basing on this concept, in this work, we tested the potential effects of a specific PPARβ/δ antagonist (GSK0660) in an in vitro model of Parkinson’s disease. Specifically, live-cell imaging, gene expression, Western blot, proteasome analyses, mitochondrial and bioenergetic studies were performed. Since we obtained promising results, we tested this antagonist in a 6-hydroxydopamine hemilesioned mouse model. In the animal model, behavioral tests, histological analysis, immunofluorescence and western blot of substantia nigra and striatum upon GSK0660 were assayed. Results: Our findings suggested that PPARβ/δ antagonist has neuroprotective potential due to neurotrophic support, anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative effects paralleled to an amelioration of mitochondria and proteasome activity. These findings are strongly supported also by the siRNA results demonstrating that by silencing PPARβ/δ a significative rescue of the dopaminergic neurons was obtained, thus indicating an involvement of PPARβ/δ in PD’s pathogenesis. Interestingly, in the animal model, GSK0660 treatment confirmed neuroprotective effects observed in the in vitro studies. Neuroprotective effects were highlighted by the behavioural performance and apomorphine rotation tests amelioration and the reduction of dopaminergic neuronal loss. These data were also confirmed by imaging and western blotting, indeed, the tested compound decreased astrogliosis and activated microglia, concomitant with an upregulation of neuroprotective pathways. Conclusions: In summary, PPARβ/δ antagonist displayed neuroprotective activities against 6-hydroxydopamine detrimental effects both in vitro and in vivo models of Parkinson’s disease, suggesting that it may represent a novel therapeutic approach for this disorder. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Infectious diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. Thus, nanotechnology provides an excellent opportunity to treat drug-resistant microbial infections. Numerous antibiotics have been used to inhibit the growth and kill of microbes, but the development of resistance and the emergence of side effects have severely limited the use of these agents. Due to the development of the nanotechnology, nanoparticles are widely used as antimicrobials. Silver and chitosan nanoparticles have antifungal, antiviral and antibacterial properties, and many studies confirm the antifungal properties of silver nanoparticles. Nowadays, the use of nanoparticles in the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases has developed due to less side effects and also the help of these particles in effective drug delivery to the target tissue. Liposomes are also used as carriers of drug delivery, genes, and modeling of cell membranes in both animals and humans. The ability of these liposomes to encapsulate large amounts of drugs, minimize unwanted side effects, high effectiveness and low toxicity has attracted the interest of researchers.

	abstract = {Blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a natural protective membrane that prevents central nervous system (CNS) from toxins and pathogens in blood. However, the presence of BBB complicates the pharmacotherapy for CNS disorders as the most chemical drugs and biopharmaceuticals have been impeded to enter the brain. Insufficient drug delivery into the brain leads to low therapeutic efficacy as well as aggravated side effects due to the accumulation in other organs and tissues. Recent breakthrough in materials science and nanotechnology provides a library of advanced materials with customized structure and property serving as a powerful toolkit for targeted drug delivery. In-depth research in the field of anatomical and pathological study on brain and BBB further facilitates the development of brain-targeted strategies for enhanced BBB crossing. In this review, the physiological structure and different cells contributing to this barrier are summarized. Various emerging strategies for permeability regulation and BBB crossing including passive transcytosis, intranasal administration, ligands conjugation, membrane coating, stimuli-triggered BBB disruption, and other strategies to overcome BBB obstacle are highlighted. Versatile drug delivery systems ranging from organic, inorganic, and biologics-derived materials with their synthesis procedures and unique physio-chemical properties are summarized and analyzed. This review aims to provide an up-to-date and comprehensive guideline for researchers in diverse fields, offering perspectives on further development of brain-targeted drug delivery system. © 2023, The Author(s).},

A total of three standardized box-shaped defects were created bilaterally in the iliac bones of six male sheep. Dental implants were placed in the center of each defect, and a control implant was placed in intact bone (Control group). After implant placement, three treatment modalities were randomly applied: i) CGF, ii) autogenous bone, and iii) no augmentation (Empty control group). ZrO2 implants were placed on the right ilium and Ti implants on the left ilium of each animal. After an eight-week healing period, one central histological section from each site was prepared. Histomorphometric assessments were performed to evaluate new bone formation (NBF) percentages in the defect area and bone-implant contact (BIC) values. No statistically significant differences existed between BIC values for Ti and ZrO2 implants in CGF, autogenous, and control groups. But in the empty control group, Ti implants had statistically higher BIC values than ZrO2 (p = 0.025, p < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between NBF values for Ti and ZrO2 implants in the CGF and autogenous groups. The empty control group’s NBF values for both implant materials were significantly lower than other treatment modalities (p = 0.002, p = 0.007, p < 0.005). ZrO2 and Ti implants have similar osseointegration capacity in grafted or intact bone areas, and the application of CGF to peri-implant bone defects positively affects bone regeneration. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The repair of complex bone defects remains a worldwide public health issue. Currently, utilizing biofunctionalized tissue engineering materials to achieve bone regeneration has been an important research focus. Previous studies on the biochemical repair of bone tissue focused on the exploration of intracellular signaling regulatory networks, while the modification and regulation of extracellular signaling molecules were less studied. The modification of glycosaminoglycans as important signaling molecules in the extracellular matrix to play an osteogenic role in scaffold materials is an emerging research direction. OBJECTIVE: To review the mechanism and application of glycosaminoglycan in bone tissue engineering. METHODS: PubMed and CNKI databases were searched for articles concerning glycosaminoglycans to regulate bone tissue regeneration and repair and its role and functional application in bone tissue engineering with the search terms “glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, bone tissue engineering, bone tissue engineering materials, osteogenic differentiation” in English and Chinese respectively. After primarily screening based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 85 articles with high quality and relevance were included for review. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) As an important component of the extracellular matrix, glycosaminoglycan not only binds to growth factors to facilitate their diffusion, but also promotes the interaction between receptors and ligands to regulate the signaling pathway of bone regeneration. (2) In bone tissue engineering, glycosaminoglycans are chemically modified and cross-linked, or co-modified with other natural or synthetic polymers in cell scaffolds to support cell adhesion and proliferation, and serve as signaling molecules to provide binding sites for growth factors to stabilize growth factors and promote the binding of endogenous and exogenous growth factors to their corresponding receptors, which can achieve effective bone tissue regeneration. (3) There are still many unresolved issues regarding the application of glycosaminoglycans in bone tissue engineering, such as the form and safety of the local long-term application of glycosaminoglycan, the exact mechanism of action on the fate of osteoblasts, synthesis and purification, which needs to be further improved. © 2023, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

The diagnosis of MIH was made using the criteria of the European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry (EAPD) and the MIH/HPSMs short charting form was used to score the index teeth. The results showed that the prevalence of MIH in Syrian children was 39.9%. Demarcated opacities were the most prevalent pattern of MIH defects on Permanent first molars (PFMs) and permanent incisors (PIs). Spearman rank correlation showed that the mean number of PIs and HPSMs with MIH increased when the number of affected PFMs was increased (P < 0.001). Chi-square test resulted that girls showed a higher number of severe PFMs than boys did with a statistically significant difference (x2 = 133.1, P < 0.05). Moreover, Chi-square test showed that the number of severe PFMs is higher than the number of severe PIs with a statistically significant difference (x2 = 54.9, P < 0.05). In addition, the mean dmft/DMFT index in children with MIH was found to be significantly higher than children without MIH (P < 0.05). The findings emphasize the need for early identification and management of MIH in children to prevent adverse effects on their oral health. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Owing to the unique properties of chitosan, composites of chitosan/Fe3O4 (0.25, 0.5, 0.75 wt. %) were cast, forming films, then subjected to different concentrations of glycine to be applied as a sensor for the amino acid. Prepared films were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Sensing performance was validated using UV-Vis spectroscopy. XRD data indicated that there are hydrogen bonds between Fe3O4 and chitosan structure. The interaction between chitosan and magnetite (Fe3O4) could be described as a composite in the same matrix. ATR-FTIR spectra demonstrated the broadening of chitosan/Fe3O4 bands in the range of 3360-3041 cm-1, as well as an increase in the intensity of the bands at 1638, 1564, 1151, and 704 cm-1 with the addition of Fe3O4 associated with a shift of the band at 2987 cm-1 toward lower wavenumber, indicating that Fe3O4 is embedded and interacted with chitosan. The shift of band positions of functional groups to lower wavenumber can be interpreted as the strengthening of the chemical bonds due to molecular adsorption. UV-Vis results indicated that chitosan/ Fe3O4 0.25 wt % ratio had the best sensitivity compared to pure chitosan and other chitosan/ Fe3O4 ratios. Correlating the data, it can be concluded that chitosan/Fe3O4 could act as a biosensor for the amino acid glycine. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Liver disease is prevalent worldwide. When it reaches the end stage, mortality rises to 50% or more. Although liver transplantation has emerged as the most efficient treatment for end-stage liver disease, its application has been limited by the scarcity of donor livers. The lack of acceptable donor organs implies that patients are at high risk while waiting for suitable livers. In this scenario, cell therapy has emerged as a promising treatment approach. Most of the time, transplanted cells can replace host hepatocytes and remodel the hepatic microenvironment. For instance, hepatocytes derived from donor livers or stem cells colonize and proliferate in the liver, can replace host hepatocytes, and restore liver function. Other cellular therapy candidates, such as macrophages and mesenchymal stem cells, can remodel the hepatic microenvironment, thereby repairing the damaged liver. In recent years, cell therapy has transitioned from animal research to early human studies. In this review, we will discuss cell therapy in end-stage liver disease treatment, especially focusing on various cell types utilized for cell transplantation, and elucidate the processes involved. Furthermore, we will also summarize the practical obstacles of cell therapy and offer potential solutions. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Biopolymers have a leading place in this issue, and chitosan and its derivatives are leading among them. The unique structure of chitosan allows it to exhibit a set of properties such as biodegradability, antimicrobial activity, non-toxicity, biocompatibility, and others, due to which it has found wide application in various fields. Modifications of its structure by alkylation, esterification, graft copolymerization, acylation, and other types of modification and new technologies have greatly expanded the possible applications of chitosan and its derivatives. The important aspect is also that the technologies used for modification can be attributed to green chemistry, and the modification products are eco-friendly.

	abstract = {Dermal substitutes bear a high clinical demand because of their ability to promote the healing process of cutaneous wounds by reducing the healing time the appearance and improving the functionality of the repaired tissue. Despite the increasing development of dermal substitutes, most of them are only composed of biological or biosynthetic matrices. This demonstrates the need for new developments focused on using scaffolds with cells (tissue construct) that promote the production of factors for biological signaling, wound coverage, and general support of the tissue repair process. Here, we fabricate by electrospinning two scaffolds: poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) as a control and poly(ε-caprolactone)/collagen type I (PCol) in a ratio lower collagen than previously reported, 19:1, respectively. Then, characterize their physicochemical and mechanical properties. As we bear in mind the creation of a biologically functional construct, we characterize and assess in vitro the implications of seeding human Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stromal cells (hWJ-MSCs) on both scaffolds. Finally, to determine the potential functionality of the constructs in vivo, their efficiency was evaluated in a porcine biomodel. Our findings demonstrated that collagen incorporation in the scaffolds produces fibers with similar diameters to those in the human native extracellular matrix, increases wettability, and enhances the presence of nitrogen on the scaffold surface, improving cell adhesion and proliferation. These synthetic scaffolds improved the secretion of factors by hWJ-MSCs involved in skin repair processes such as b-FGF and Angiopoietin I and induced its differentiation towards epithelial lineage, as shown by the increased expression of Involucrin and JUP. In vivo experiments confirmed that lesions treated with the PCol/hWJ-MSCs constructs might reproduce a morphological organization that seems relatively equivalent to normal skin. These results suggest that the PCol/hWJ-MSCs construct is a promising alternative for skin lesions repair in the clinic. © 2023 The Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine},

Rearranging nanoparticles to form micro-sized nanoaggregates (MNAs) with increased size, ordered structure, as well as controllable size, shape, and morphology is a crucial step in various fields of science and technology to maintain the unique characteristics of nanoparticles while obtaining greatly enhanced or new performance at the microscale. The structure of MNAs prominently affects their functionality, which is determined by the arrangement of nanoparticles and the interaction between primary particles. Several methods have been proposed to prepare the MNAs, in which spray-drying technology stands out considering the feasibility, scalability for industry, cost, and efficiency. Forced assembly of nanoparticles through spray-drying under tunable process parameters yields diverse physical properties and structural arrangements of nanoparticles of the MNAs, they therefore exhibit enormous potential in a wide range of application fields. This review presents the construction and applications of spray-dried MNAs. The factors that influence the size, morphology, and structure of the MNAs are discussed in detail. In addition, the outstanding application performance resulting from the tightly packed nanoparticles in regular-shaped MNAs obtained by the spray-drying process is illustrated. © 2023 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exosomes can improve the inflammatory microenvironment of the degenerated intervertebral disc. However, direct injection of exosomes into the degenerated intervertebral disc at local concentrations and transient release cannot guarantee sustained effects, so the in vivo therapeutic effect of exosomes alone is limited. OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of exosome-loaded glucan/gelatin composite hydrogel on repairing rat degenerative intervertebral disc. METHODS: Exosomes were extracted from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells of rats. Exosome-loaded dextran/gelatin composite hydrogels were prepared by Schiff crosslinking reaction, and the microstructure and elastic modulus of the hydrogels were detected. Sixty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups, with 12 rats in each group. Group A was the normal control. In groups B, C, D, and E, the intervertebral disc degeneration model was established by percutaneous puncture. PBS, exosomes, glucan/gelatin composite hydrogel and exosome-loaded glucan/gelatin composite hydrogel were injected into the intervertebral disc in turn. At postoperative 8 weeks, imaging, histopathology and western blot assay were performed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) The exosome-loaded glucan/gelatin composite hydrogels presented a three-dimensional porous structure with interconnected pores. The pore size was 50-200 μm, and the elastic modulus was (4.41±0.23) kPa, respectively. The exosomes could be released continuously and stably in vitro for more than 20 days. (2) At 8 weeks after operation, X-ray films exhibited that the intervertebral disc height index percentages of rats in groups B-E were lower than those in group A (P < 0.05). The intervertebral disc height index percentages of rats in groups C, D and E were higher than those in group B (P < 0.05), of which group E was the most obvious. At 8 weeks after operation, MRI examination showed compared with group A, the tissue structure of nucleus pulposus in groups B-E was damaged to different degrees. Compared with group B, the tissue structure of nucleus pulposus in groups C-E was improved to varying degrees, among which group E had the most obvious improvement. (3) Hematoxylin-eosin staining and saffron O staining at 8 weeks after surgery exhibited that the structure of the nucleus pulposus in group B was severely damaged and only contained a small amount of collagen. Compared with group B, the structure of nucleus pulposus in groups C-E was improved, and the structure of nucleus pulposus in group E was finer, clearer, regular and had the most collagen content. (4) Western blot assay demonstrated that compared with group A, the expression levels of type II collagen and proteoglycan protein in groups B-E were decreased (P < 0.05). Compared with group B, the expression levels of type II collagen and proteoglycan protein in groups C-E were increased (P < 0.05), and those in group E were the most obvious. (5) It is concluded that the dextran/gelatin composite hydrogel loaded with exosomes injected into the degenerative intervertebral disc can restore the intervertebral disc height and intervertebral disc signal intensity, restore the tissue structure, and delay intervertebral disc degeneration to a certain extent. © 2023, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

	abstract = {Controlling neuronal activity using implantable neural interfaces constitutes an important tool to understand and develop novel strategies against brain diseases. Infrared neurostimulation is a promising alternative to optogenetics for controlling the neuronal circuitry with high spatial resolution. However, bi-directional interfaces capable of simultaneously delivering infrared light and recording electrical signals from the brain with minimal inflammation have not yet been reported. Here, we have developed a soft fibre-based device using high-performance polymers which are >100-fold softer than conventional silica glass used in standard optical fibres. The developed implant is capable of stimulating the brain activity in localized cortical domains by delivering laser pulses in the 2 μm spectral region while recording electrophysiological signals. Action and local field potentials were recorded in vivo from the motor cortex and hippocampus in acute and chronic settings, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis of the brain tissue indicated insignificant inflammatory response to the infrared pulses while the signal-to-noise ratio of recordings still remained high. Our neural interface constitutes a step forward in expanding infrared neurostimulation as a versatile approach for fundamental research and clinically translatable therapies. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Termites are known as social insects worldwide. Presently in China 473 species, 44 genera and 4 families of termites have been reported. Of them, 111 Reticulitermes species are widely spread in different zones of China. The dispersion flight season of these Chinese Reticulitermes species are usually started from February to June, but in some regions different species are distributed, sharing their boundaries and having overlapping flight seasons. These reasons become important sources of hybridization between two different heterospecific populations of termites. It was confirmed that the fertilized eggs and unfertilized eggs of some Reticulitermes termites have the capacity of cleavage. While the unfertilized eggs of R. aculabialis, R. chinensis and R. labralis cleaved normally and the only R. aculabialis unfertilized eggs develop in embryos. While, the R. flaviceps and R. chinensis were observed with their abnormal embryonic development, and not hatching of eggs parthenogenetically. They were reported more threatening to Chinese resources as they propagate with parthenogenesis, hybridization and sexual reproduction. Eggshell and macrophiles of eggs play important roles in species identification and control. Although, they are severe pests and cause a wide range of damages to wooden structures and products in homes, buildings, building materials, trees, crops, and forests in China’s Mainland. © 2024, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia.

	abstract = {Skin flap transplantation is one of the most common tissue transplantation methods for wound repair and organ reconstruction in plastic surgery. During the transplantation process, the inflammatory response of transplanted flap and angiogenesis are critical to the successful rate of skin flap transplantation. In recent years, to improve the biocompatibility and cell affinity of biomedical materials, the modified biomaterials have gradually become a popular subject in scientific researches. In our study, the IL-4 modified expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE) surgical patch IL4-e-PTFE was prepared, and the rat skin flap transplantation model was constructed. The results of cell experiment prove that IL-4 has potentiation in the angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) induced by monocyte, and IL-4 can also promote angiogenesis by inducing the M2 macrophages. According to the results of in vivo experiment, the apoptosis level of transplanted flap cells of rats in the IL4-e-PTFE group was lower than that in the e-PTFE group, and in the IL4-e-PTFE group, the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α showed significantly decline compared to the e-PTFE group, while the expression levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-1Ra, IL-10 and TGF-β presented significant increase compared to the e-PTFE group; the immunofluorescence staining results show that the number of M2 macrophages in transplanted flap area of rats in the IL4-e-PTFE group was significantly higher than that in the e-PTFE group, and the angiogenesis level was remarkably improved. In this study, by preparing IL4-e-PTFE and carrying out the cell and in vivo experiments, a reference method is proposed, which can reduce the inflammatory response during skin transplantation process using e-PTFE and optimize the long-term effects of flap blood vessels, hoping to provide a broader space for the applications of e-PTFE in medicine. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Due to its natural origin, which confers biodegradability and biocompatibility properties, in addition to its low toxicity, chitosan has been gaining attention in numerous sectors, such as agriculture, food, medicine, pharmaceuticals, etc., including also important oenological applications due to its potential as a green alternative to the use of sulphite. Among the many applications that can be generated from these materials in the wine-making area, their use has been reported for the clarification of must; in the preparation of films for the removal of contaminants, whether organics such as ochratoxin A or inorganics such as some metal ions and their salts; the control of turbidity caused by protein precipitation; the encapsulation of yeasts of oenological interest and enzymes for the control of adverse microorganisms such as Brettanomyces; the manufacture of sensors and nanosensors for the quantification of contaminants, the quality control of starting materials and final products, the optimisation of fermentation processes, the monitoring of storage conditions, etc. As a result of this review, significant development of the applications of this material in the oenological area can be expected, especially due to the possibilities of preparing new derivatives, including the great variety of these that have been recently proposed through click reactions, as well as the growing incursion of chitosan in nanobiotechnology. © 2023, International Viticulture and Enology Society.

	abstract = {The design of nanostructured materials occupies a privileged position in the development and management of affordable and effective technology in the antibacterial sector. Here, we discuss the antimicrobial properties of three carbonaceous nanoblades and nanodarts materials of graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (RGO), and single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) that have a mechano-bactericidal effect, and the ability to piercing or slicing bacterial membranes. To demonstrate the significance of size, morphology and composition on the antibacterial activity mechanism, the designed nanomaterials have been characterized. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), standard agar well diffusion, and transmission electron microscopy were utilized to evaluate the antibacterial activity of GO, RGO, and SWCNTs. Based on the evidence obtained, the three carbonaceous materials exhibit activity against all microbial strains tested by completely encapsulating bacterial cells and causing morphological disruption by degrading the microbial cell membrane in the order of RGO > GO > SWCNTs. Because of the external cell wall structure and outer membrane proteins, the synthesized carbonaceous nanomaterials exhibited higher antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacterial strains than Gram-negative and fungal microorganisms. RGO had the lowest MIC values (0.062, 0.125, and 0.25 mg/mL against B. subtilis, S. aureus, and E. coli, respectively), as well as minimum fungal concentrations (0.5 mg/mL for both A. fumigatus and C. albicans). At 12 hr, the cell viability values against tested microbial strains were completely suppressed. Cell lysis and death occurred as a result of severe membrane damage caused by microorganisms perched on RGO nanoblades. Our work gives an insight into the design of effective graphene-based antimicrobial materials for water treatment and remediation. © 2023},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: So far, the subversive treatment of traumatic brain injury is very limited. The combination of medicine and engineering has brought new prospects for the repair and regeneration of central nervous system nerves. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic effect of collagen/silk fibroin scaffold that can carry seed cells and is safe and porous, combined with human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells on traumatic brain injury in beagle dogs. METHODS: (1) Passage 3 human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells were inoculated onto collagen/silk fibroin scaffold. The growth of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells was observed by inverted phase contrast microscope, scanning electron microscope, immunofluorescence staining and hematoxylin-eosin staining. (2) Twenty-four beagle dogs were randomly divided into four groups. In the trauma group, only the traumatic brain injury model was established without other treatment. In the stem cell group, human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells were transplanted after model establishment. In the scaffold group, the collagen/silk fibroin scaffold was transplanted after model establishment. In the combination group, human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells and collagen/silk fibroin scaffold were transplanted after model establishment. The grafts were all transplanted locally in the injured area. At 1 day, 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks after operation, a modified Glasgow Coma Scale was performed respectively. Motor-evoked potentials were detected at 1, 3 and 6 months after operation. At 6 months after operation, magnetic resonance imaging and in situ hybridization of brain tissue repair RNA were performed to evaluate the recovery of traumatic brain injury. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) Human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells attached to collagen/silk fibroin scaffold surface grew well and extended many pseudopods. (2) Modified Glasgow Coma Scale score of the combination group was significantly higher than that of the trauma group, stem cell group and scaffold group at 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks after operation (P < 0.05). (3) The latency and amplitude of motor-evoked potential of the combination group at 1, 3 and 6 months were significantly better than those of the trauma group under different constant pressure stimuli (P < 0.01). (4) Diffusion tensor imaging of magnetic resonance scanning showed that the integrity of the corticospinal tract in the combination group was better than that in the trauma, stem cell and scaffold groups, and a new corticospinal tract could be seen on the injured side. (5) The results of in situ hybridization of brain tissue repair RNA demonstrated that the expression levels of synaptophysin, microtubule-associated protein 2, von Willebrand factor, neurofilament protein and MBP in the combination group were more than those in the trauma, stem cell and scaffold groups. (6) It is indicated that human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells combined with collagen/silk fibroin scaffold play an active role in corticospinal tract regeneration, motor function recovery, angiogenesis and neurite growth in dogs with traumatic brain injury. © 2023, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

	abstract = {As an ultrasmall derivative of black phosphorus (BP) sheets, BP quantum dots (BP-QDs) have been effectively used in many fields. Currently, information on the cardiotoxicity induced by BP-QDs remains limited. We aimed to evaluate BP-QD-induced cardiac toxicity in mice. Histopathological examination of heart tissue sections was performed. Transcriptome sequencing, real-time quantitative PCR (RT‒qPCR), western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assays were used to detect the mRNA and/or protein expression of proinflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K-AKT), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), and glucose/lipid metabolism pathway-related genes. We found that heart weight and heart/body weight index (HBI) were significantly reduced in mice after intragastric administration of 0.1 or 1 mg/kg BP-QDs for 28 days. In addition, obvious inflammatory cell infiltration and increased cardiomyocyte diameter were observed in the BP-QD-treated groups. Altered expression of proinflammatory cytokines and genes related to the NF-κB signaling pathway further confirmed that BP-QD exposure induced inflammatory responses. In addition, BP-QD treatment also affected the PI3K-AKT, PPARγ, thermogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and cardiac muscle contraction signaling pathways. The expression of genes related to glucose/lipid metabolism signaling pathways was dramatically affected by BP-QD exposure, and the effect was primarily mediated by the PPAR signaling pathway. Our study provides new insights into the toxicity of BP-QDs to human health. © 2023},

However, current MNRs lack the capability to collectively perceive and report physicochemical changes in unknown microenvironments. Here we propose to develop swarming responsive photonic nanorobots that can map local physicochemical conditions on the fly and further guide localized photothermal treatment. The RPNRs consist of a photonic nanochain of periodically-assembled magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles encapsulated in a responsive hydrogel shell, and show multiple integrated functions, including energetic magnetically-driven swarming motions, bright stimuli-responsive structural colors, and photothermal conversion. Thus, they can actively navigate in complex environments utilizing their controllable swarming motions, then visualize unknown targets (e.g., tumor lesion) by collectively mapping out local abnormal physicochemical conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, or glucose concentration) via their responsive structural colors, and further guide external light irradiation to initiate localized photothermal treatment.

	abstract = {To improve the adsorption and catalytic performance of heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts for oil wastes, amino acids were used to modify nanoscale zero-valent iron (AA@Fe0), which were applied in the Fenton-like degradation of organic solvents (tributyl phosphate and n-dodecane, named TBP and DD). Twelve amino acids, i.e., glycine (Gly), alanine (Ala), leucine (Leu), proline (Pro), phenylalanine (Phe), methionine (Met), cysteine (Cys), asparagine (Asn), serine (Ser), glutamic acid (Glu), lysine (Lys) and arginine (Arg), were selected and calculated by density functional theory (DFT). The optimized structure, charge distribution, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), interaction region indicator (IRI) isosurface map and adsorption energy of AA@Fe0, AA@Fe0−TBP and AA@Fe0−DD were studied, which indicated that Fe is more likely to approach and charge transfer with -COO and -NH3 on the α-carbon of amino acids. There is strong attraction between Fe and –COO, and Van der Waals force between Fe and -NH3, respectively. In the interaction of AA@Fe0 with TBP and DD, Van der Waal force plays an important role. AA@Fe0 was synthesized in laboratory and characterized to investigate physicochemical properties. In Fenton-like degradation of organic solvents, the change of COD in water phase during the degradation process as well as the volume of the organic phase after the reaction were investigated. The results of calculations combined with experiments showed that Ser-modified Fe0 performed the best in these amino acids, with 98% removal of organic solvents. A possible catalytic mechanism was proposed in which amino acids acted a linking role between Fe and organic solvents, activating H2O2 to generate hydroxyl radicals for the degradation of organic solvents. © 2022},

	abstract = {The advancements in the cell culture studies have led to the development of regenerative medicine concept. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of some washing solutions, including phosphate buffered saline (PBS), sodium chloride (NaCl), and ringer’s lactate (RL) on the rate of detachment and confluency in fibroblast and osteoblast cell culture. Baby Hamster Kidney 21 clone 13 (BHK21/C13) fibroblast cells and 7F2 osteoblast were cultured on T25 flasks for 3-4 days. Three treatment groups were classified on the basis of different washing solutions used in the moment before trypsinization: PBS, 0.9% NaCl, and RL. Each group was measured for the detachment rate and cell confluence. The measurement was done in 2 passage numbers. The use of PBS, NaCl, and RL washing solution showed that detachment time was less than 5 minutes for the fibroblasts and 3 minutes for the osteoblasts. There was a significant difference in the rate of fibroblast cell detachment (p=0.006) and osteoblast (p=0.016). The capability of fibroblasts and osteoblasts to achieve a confluence of 106 cells/well on the first and second measurements was almost the same between the washing solution groups. The use of physiological 0.9% NaCl solution as a washing solution in fibroblast and osteoblast cell culture has almost the same effectiveness as PBS to help accelerate cell detachment in less than 5 minutes without influencing the capability of cells to proliferate. © 2024, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia.

	abstract = {The origins of wound myofibroblasts and scar tissue remains unclear, but it is assumed to involve conversion of adipocytes into myofibroblasts. Here, we directly explore the potential plasticity of adipocytes and fibroblasts after skin injury. Using genetic lineage tracing and live imaging in explants and in wounded animals, we observe that injury induces a transient migratory state in adipocytes with vastly distinct cell migration patterns and behaviours from fibroblasts. Furthermore, migratory adipocytes, do not contribute to scar formation and remain non-fibrogenic in vitro, in vivo and upon transplantation into wounds in animals. Using single-cell and bulk transcriptomics we confirm that wound adipocytes do not convert into fibrogenic myofibroblasts. In summary, the injury-induced migratory adipocytes remain lineage-restricted and do not converge or reprogram into a fibrosing phenotype. These findings broadly impact basic and translational strategies in the regenerative medicine field, including clinical interventions for wound repair, diabetes, and fibrotic pathologies. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by gradual memory loss and declining cognitive and executive functions. AD is the most common cause of dementia, affecting more than 50 million people worldwide, and is a major health concern in society. Despite decades of research, the cause of AD is not well understood and there is no effective curative treatment so far. Therefore, there is an urgent need to increase understanding of AD pathophysiology in the hope of developing a much-needed cure. Dissecting the cellular and molecular mechanisms of AD pathogenesis has been challenging as the most commonly used model systems such as transgenic animals and two-dimensional neuronal culture do not fully recapitulate the pathological hallmarks of AD. The recent advent of three-dimensional human brain organoids confers unique opportunities to study AD in a humanised model system by encapsulating many aspects of AD pathology. In the present review, we summarise the studies of AD using human brain organoids that recapitulate the major pathological components of AD including amyloid-β and tau aggregation, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and synaptic and circuitry dysregulation. Additionally, the current challenges and future directions of the brain organoids modelling system are discussed. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.},

	abstract = {Bacteria-caused wound infection greatly threatens human health, thus developing an efficient and safe antibacterial agent without drug resistance is still a great challenge. Herein, a confined vulcanization strategy is proposed to construct copper sulfides-loaded dual-mesoporous silica nanospheres (CuxSy@DMSNs) with various crystal phases for reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated and photothermal antibacterial application. With the pore confinement of DMSNs, the crystal phases of copper sulfides including CuS, Cu9S5 and Cu1.96S can be easily controlled by changing the vulcanization temperature. The relationships between the crystal phases and photothermal properties as well as peroxidase-like activity of copper sulfides were systematically investigated. Results show that the obtained CuS@DMSNs exhibited higher photothermal ability with remarkable photothermal conversion efficiency of 36.86% in the second near-infrared region (NIR-II) and better peroxidase-like activity, compared to those of Cu9S5@DMSNs and Cu1.96S@DMSNs. As a result, the in vitro experiments showed the good antibacterial effect against both gram-negative E. coli and gram-positive S. aureus under 1064 nm laser irradiation and the presence of H2O2. Besides, the CCK-8 assay indicated that CuS@p-DMSNs have minimal cytotoxicity against normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells at the ranged concentrations. Therefore, the resultant CuS@p-DMSNs could act as a promising antibacterial agent for deep wound bacterial infection treatment. © 2023 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences},

	abstract = {Metformin is a versatile drug with numerous medical uses. It is known primarily as an anti-hyperglycemic drug that has become the main oral blood-glucose-lowering medication for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus globally. Its use has been reported in a variety of oral conditions and dentistry in general. Recent clinical trials have indicated the effectiveness of adjunct topical application of metformin in improving the periodontal parameters of patients with diabetes and periodontitis. Additionally, studies have suggested that metformin stimulates odontogenic differentiation and mineral synthesis of stem cells in the tooth pulp. Metformin also stimulates osteoblast proliferation, decreases osteoclast activity and exerts regenerative effects on periodontal bone, thus making it a viable candidate for periodontal regeneration. Metformin monotherapy significantly enhances osseointegration of endosseous implants and has been reported to have anti-cancer effects on oral squamous cell carcinoma by impeding tumor progression. Animal studies have indicated that metformin improves orthodontic tooth movement and resists orthodontic appliance corrosion. This narrative review aims to provide a current summary of research highlighting the prospective uses of metformin in dentistry. © 2023 [The Author/The Authors]},

	abstract = {Background: Tendon injuries are among the most common musculoskeletal disorders. Celecoxib possesses an effective anti-inflammatory activity in the tendon injury treatment. Lactoferrin has a great potential for the tendon regeneration. However, the efficacy of celecoxib combined with lactoferrin in the treatment of tendon injury has not been reported. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of celecoxib and lactoferrin on tendon injury and repair, and screen for the crucial genes associated with the tendon injury and repair. Methods: The rat tendon injury models were established and divided into four groups: normal control group (n = 10), tendon injury model group (n = 10), celecoxib treatment group (n = 10), and celecoxib + lactoferrin treatment group (n = 10). Then, RNA sequencing was performed to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs), miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and mRNAs (DEmRNAs) in celecoxib treatment group and celecoxib + lactoferrin treatment group. Next, autophagy/hypoxia/ferroptosis/pyroptosis-related DEmRNAs were further identified. Subsequently, functional enrichment, protein–protein interaction (PPI) network and transcriptional regulatory network construction for these genes were performed. Results: The animal study demonstrated that combinational administration of celecoxib with lactoferrin rescued the harmful effects caused by celecoxib in the treatment of tendon injury. Compared to tendon injury model group, 945 DEmRNAs, 7 DEmiRNAs and 34 DElncRNAs were obtained in celecoxib treatment group, and 493 DEmRNAs, 8 DEmiRNAs and 21 DElncRNAs were obtained in celecoxib + lactoferrin treatment group, respectively. Subsequently, 376 celecoxib + lactoferrin treatment group-specific DEmRNAs were determined. Then, 25 DEmRNAs associated with autophagy/hypoxia/ferroptosis/pyroptosis were identified. Conclusions: Several genes, such as, Ppp1r15a, Ddit4, Fos, Casp3, Tgfb3, Hspb1 and Hspa8, were identified to be associated with tendon injury and repair. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Manganese dioxide nanoparticles (MnO2-NPs) have a wide range of applications in biomedicine. Given this widespread usage, it is worth noting that MnO2-NPs are definitely toxic, especially to the brain. However, the damage caused by MnO2-NPs to the choroid plexus (CP) and to the brain after crossing CP epithelial cells has not been elucidated. Therefore, this study aims to investigate these effects and elucidate potential underlying mechanisms through transcriptomics analysis. To achieve this objective, eighteen SD rats were randomly divided into three groups: the control group (control), low-dose exposure group (low-dose) and high-dose exposure group (high-dose). Animals in the two treated groups were administered with two concentrations of MnO2-NPs (200 mg kg−1 BW and 400 mg kg−1 BW) using a noninvasive intratracheal injection method once a week for three months. Finally, the neural behavior of all the animals was tested using a hot plate tester, open-field test and Y-type electric maze. The morphological characteristics of the CP and hippocampus were observed by H&E stain, and the transcriptome of CP tissues was analysed by transcriptome sequencing. The representative differentially expressed genes were quantified by qRT-PCR. We found that treatment with MnO2-NPs could induce learning capacity and memory faculty decline and destroy the structure of hippocampal and CP cells in rats. High doses of MnO2-NPs had a more obvious destructive capacity. For transcriptomic analysis, we found that there were significant differences in the numbers and types of differential genes in CP between the low- and high-dose groups compared to the control. Through GO terms and KEGG analysis, high-dose MnO2-NPs significantly affected the expression of transporters, ion channel proteins, and ribosomal proteins. There were 17 common differentially expressed genes. Most of them were transporter and binding genes on the cell membrane, and some of them had kinase activity. Three genes, Brinp, Synpr and Crmp1, were selected for qRT-PCR to confirm their expression differences among the three groups. In conclusion, high-dose MnO2-NPs exposure induced abnormal neurobehaviour, impaired memory function, destroyed the structure of the CP and changed its transcriptome in rats. The most significant DEGs in the CP were within the transport system. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This study aimed to improve encapsulated doxorubicin ENC-DOX efficiency via loading into pectin nanoparticle PNPs and to investigate the antitumor efficacy of Doxorubicin DOX and ENC-DOX in Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma EAC bearing-mice. ENC-DOX was optimally fabricated and characterized; female albino mice were divided into 6 groups group 1: control CON, group 2: EAC induced by once injection of 2.5 x 106 EAC/ml, group 3: EAC+DOX received 12mg/kg of DOX i.p, group 4: EAC+PNPs received orally 12mg/kg PNPs, group 5: EAC+DOX+PNPs as the same previous dose and route, and group 6: EAC+ENC-DOX received 12mg/kg of ENC-DOX orally. The treatment with ENC-DOX resulted in a significant reduction in mean tumor weight MTW, improvement in mean survival time MST, and an increase in life span ILS. Also, ENC-DOX ameliorated the cardiac CK and LDH and decreased MDA levels associated with improvement in GPX, GSH, and SOD levels and reduced the level of TNF-α and MCP-1; also, ENC-DOX caused depletion in caspase-3 and P53 with an elevation of Bcl2 level comparing with treatment with free DOX, dimensioned histological lesions were noticed in the heart tissue sections of mice administrated ENC-DOX. The treatment of EAC mice with ENC-DOX displayed a promising potential antitumor effect with greater safety than free DOX. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Objective: Occlusal splints are always applied on individuals with bruxism to reduce tooth wear and relieve orofacial symptoms such as myofascial pain. The stomatognathic system is mainly composed of tooth, occlusion, masticatory muscles, and temporomandibular joint. The occlusion and masticatory muscles function are regarded as the important parameters for evaluating the stomatognathic system state objectively. However, the effects of occlusal splints on individuals with bruxism is rarely elucidated from accurate neuromuscular analysis and occlusion evaluation. The aim of the present study was to estimate the effects of three different splints (two clinically common full coverage occlusal splint and an modified anterior splint) on subjects with bruxism using K7-J5 neuromuscular analysis system and Dental Prescale II (DP2) to evaluate occlusion. Methods: Sixteen subjects claimed to be suffering from nocturnal bruxism,with complete dentition and stable occlusal relationship, were selected for study.The intermaxillary space and the baselines of EMG-activity of the anterior temporalis and masseter were recorded for all the subjects. The participants was treated with three different splints, and outcomes were estimated by comfort index, occlusion and surface electromyography of anterior temporalis and masseter. Results: At teeth clenched position, EMG data were significantly lower in the participants with use of modified anterior splint than with hard, soft occlusal splint or without splint (p < 0.05). The maximum bite force and bite area occur in subjects without use of splint, while the minimal occur in subjects with use of modified anterior splint. Intermaxillary space increased and masticatory muscles presented significant reduction of EMG data at rest position as a result of J5 (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Modified anterior splint seems to be more comfortable and effective in reducing occlusion force and electromyographic activity of anterior temporalis and masseter for subjects with bruxism. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Abstract: Study design: A randomized, controlled, prospective multicenter clinical trial with a parallel group design was initiated in eight surgical centers to compare a large-pore polypropylene mesh (Ultrapro®) to a small-pore polypropylene mesh (Premilene®) within a standardized retromuscular meshplasty for incisional hernia repair. Methods: Between 2004 and 2006, patients with a fascial defect with a minimum diameter of 4 cm after vertical midline laparotomy were recruited for the trial. Patients underwent retromuscular meshplasty with either a large-pore or a small-pore mesh to identify the superiority of the large-pore mesh. Follow-up visits were scheduled at 5 and 21 days and 4, 12, and 24 months after surgery. A clinical examination, a modified short form 36 (SF-36®), a daily activity questionnaire, and an ultrasound investigation of the abdominal wall were completed at every follow-up visit. The primary outcome criterion was foreign body sensation at the 12-month visit, and the secondary endpoint criteria were the occurrence of hematoma, seroma, and chronic pain within 24 months postoperatively. Results: In 8 centers, 181 patients were included in the study. Neither foreign body sensation within the first year after surgery (27.5% Ultrapro®, 32.2% Premilene®) nor the time until the first occurrence of foreign body sensation within the first year was significantly different between the groups. Regarding the secondary endpoints, no significant differences could be observed. At the 2-year follow-up, recurrences occurred in 5 Ultrapro® patients (5.5%) and 4 Premilene® patients (4.4%). Conclusion: Despite considerable differences in theoretical and experimental works, we have not been able to identify differences in surgical or patient-reported outcomes between the use of large- and small-pore meshes for retromuscular incisional hernia repair.

	abstract = {Up-to-date research in biology, biotechnology, and medicine requires fast genome and transcriptome analysis technologies to investigate cellular state, physiology, and activity. Gene expression is the process of generating messenger RNA copies of a gene. The transcriptome, which contains the mRNA of the cell, reflects the cell's overall gene expression pattern. Understanding the nature and frequency of each RNA molecule in a given cell under certain circumstances is necessary to examine the transcriptome. Microarray and serial analysis of gene expression are two primary techniques researchers use in transcriptome studies. Here, microarray technology and next-generation sequencing of transcripts are states of the art. Since microarray technology is limited to RNA, quantifying transcript levels and sequence information, RNA-Seq provides nearly unlimited possibilities in modern bioanalysis. Sequencing of RNA, or RNA-Seq, is now a standard method to analyze gene expression and uncover novel RNA species. In addition, aspects of RNA biogenesis and metabolism can be interrogated with specialized techniques for cDNA library preparation. The present study will introduce and compare new high-performance methods used in examining the transcriptome. This also presents a detailed description of next-generation sequencing, describes the impact of this technology on transcriptome analysis, and explains its possibilities to explore the modern RNA world. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The study investigates some biological indices and chemical compositions of Callinectes amnicola and their potential for reuse in the context of the circular economy paradigm. The total of 322 mixed-sex C. amnicola collected over a period of six months was examined. The morphometric and meristic characteristics were estimated for biometric assessment. The gonads were obtained from the female crabs for gonadosomatic indices. The shell was obtained using the hand removal technique by detaching it from the crab body. The edible and shell portions were processed separately and subjected to chemical analysis. Our findings showed that females had the highest sex ratio across the six months. The slope values (b) for both sexes exhibited negative allometric growth across all months since the slope values obtained were less than 3 (b < 3). The values obtained for Fulton’s condition factor (K) of crabs in all examined months were greater than 1. The edible portion had the highest moisture level at 62.57 ± 2.16% and varied significantly (P < 0.05). The high amount of total ash obtained in the shell sample showed that ash is the main mineral present in crab shells and showed a significant difference (P < 0.05). The shell sample had the highest concentrations of Na and CaCO3. Based on the findings of this study, it was observed that the shell waste contains some essential and transitional minerals (Ca, CaCO3, Na, and Mg) and can be utilized as catalysts in several local and industrial applications, such as pigments, adsorbents, therapeutics, livestock feeds, biomedical industries, liming, fertilization, and so on. Proper valorization of this shell waste should be encouraged rather than discarding it. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Because organic molecules and materials are generally insensitive or weakly sensitive to magnetic fields, a certain means to enhance their magnetic responsiveness needs to be exploited. Here we show a strategy to amplify the magnetic responsiveness of self-assembled peptide nanostructures by synergistically combining the concepts of perfect α-helix and rod-coil supramolecular building blocks. Firstly, we develop a monomeric, nonpolar, and perfect α-helix (MNP-helix). Then, we employ the MNP-helix as the rod block of rod-coil amphiphiles (rod-coils) because rod-coils are well-suited for fabricating responsive assemblies. We show that the self-assembly processes of the designed rod-coils and disassembly of rod-coil/DNA complexes can be controlled in a magnetically responsive manner using the relatively weak magnetic field provided by the ordinary neodymium magnet [0.07 ~ 0.25 Tesla (T)]. These results demonstrate that magnetically responsive organic assemblies usable under practical conditions can be realized by using rod-coil supramolecular building blocks containing constructively organized diamagnetic moieties. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Tilapia has high-temperature tolerance, can breed in captivity, grow fast, and have excellent cost-benefit. Because of these characteristics, this species is of great interest in aquaculture and, currently, the most produced fish in Brazil. However, by increasing tilapia production, there was also a rise in the amount of organic waste, mainly from filleting, which discards 70% of waste. There are many studies on collagen extraction from tilapia skin as an alternative to reduce these residues and add commercial value. In this work, the extraction of protein concentrate was tested using an acid protocol, in which the tilapia skins underwent a pre-treatment in an acid medium and saline precipitation, with variations in time and concentration. After its extraction, the skin was evaluated for ash, moisture, protein, solubility, and pH. The protein concentrate obtained showed low ash contents, and the humidity is within those presented by the literature. The protein concentrate showed levels from 68.73 to 80.58% of protein and a low solubility between 4.03 to 6.93%. In conclusion, acid extraction is a possible means of collagen extraction, and tilapia skin is a good alternative to reuse waste generated in the fish industry. © 2024, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia.

	abstract = {Vision depends on accurate signal conduction from the retina to the brain through the optic nerve, an important part of the central nervous system that consists of bundles of axons originating from retinal ganglion cells. The mammalian optic nerve, an important part of the central nervous system, cannot regenerate once it is injured, leading to permanent vision loss. To date, there is no clinical treatment that can regenerate the optic nerve and restore vision. Our previous study found that the mobile zinc (Zn 2 +) level increased rapidly after optic nerve injury in the retina, specifically in the vesicles of the inner plexiform layer. Furthermore, chelating Zn 2 + significantly promoted axonal regeneration with a long-term effect. In this study, we conditionally knocked out zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3) in amacrine cells or retinal ganglion cells to construct two transgenic mouse lines (VGAT Cre ZnT3 fl/fl and VGLUT2 Cre ZnT3 fl/fl, respectively). We obtained direct evidence that the rapidly increased mobile Zn 2 + in response to injury was from amacrine cells. We also found that selective deletion of ZnT3 in amacrine cells promoted retinal ganglion cell survival and axonal regeneration after optic nerve crush injury, improved retinal ganglion cell function, and promoted vision recovery. Sequencing analysis of reginal ganglion cells revealed that inhibiting the release of presynaptic Zn 2 + affected the transcription of key genes related to the survival of retinal ganglion cells in postsynaptic neurons, regulated the synaptic connection between amacrine cells and retinal ganglion cells, and affected the fate of retinal ganglion cells. These results suggest that amacrine cells release Zn 2 + to trigger transcriptomic changes related to neuronal growth and survival in reginal ganglion cells, thereby influencing the synaptic plasticity of retinal networks. These results make the theory of zinc-dependent retinal ganglion cell death more accurate and complete and provide new insights into the complex interactions between retinal cell networks. © 2023 Neural Regeneration Research.},

	abstract = {Diagnostic and therapeutic illumination on internal organs and tissues with high controllability and adaptability in terms of spectrum, area, depth, and intensity remains a major challenge. Here, we present a flexible, biodegradable photonic device called iCarP with a micrometer scale air gap between a refractive polyester patch and the embedded removable tapered optical fiber. ICarP combines the advantages of light diffraction by the tapered optical fiber, dual refractions in the air gap, and reflection inside the patch to obtain a bulb-like illumination, guiding light towards target tissue. We show that iCarP achieves large area, high intensity, wide spectrum, continuous or pulsatile, deeply penetrating illumination without puncturing the target tissues and demonstrate that it supports phototherapies with different photosensitizers. We find that the photonic device is compatible with thoracoscopy-based minimally invasive implantation onto beating hearts. These initial results show that iCarP could be a safe, precise and widely applicable device suitable for internal organs and tissue illumination and associated diagnosis and therapy. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Here, a pollen-derived biochar catalyst with a unique honeycomb-like structure, coupled with the dispersion of magnetic Fe3O4/FeS (Fe/S) nanoparticles, was synthesized by simple impregnation precursor, followed by pyrolysis. The prepared Fe/S-biochar catalyst demonstrated outstanding phenol degradation efficiency across a wide pH range, with 98% of which eliminated even under neutral conditions (pH 7.0). The high catalytic activity was due to the multilevel porous structure of pollen-derived biochar provided enough active sites and allowed for better electron transfer, then increases oxidation ability to promote the reaction. Moreover, the acid microenvironment formed by SO42− group from Fe/S composite extended the pH range for Fenton reaction, and S2− facilitated the conversion of [tbnd]Fe3+ to [tbnd]Fe2+, resulting in remarkable degradation efficiency. Further, biochar can effectively promote cycling stability by limiting Fe leaching. This work may provide a general strategy for designing 3D framework biochar-based Fe/S catalysts with excellent performance for heterogeneous Fenton reactions. © 2022},

Ninety-three (93) English language in-vitro studies were included. The percentage of the mean bond strength change was recorded prior to and after artificial aging, and the weighted mean values and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Bonding protocols were classified based on the combination of MDP/non-MDP containing cement/primer and surface pretreatment, as well as the level of artificial aging performed. Alumina sandblasting (SA) was identified as the most frequently used surface pre-treatment while an insufficient number of studies was identified for each category of alternative surface treatments. The combination of MDP cement with tribochemical silica coating (TSC) or SA yielded more durable results after aging, while the application of SA and TSC improved bond durability when a non-MDP cement and a non-MDP primer were used. TSC may lead to increased bond durability compared to SA, whereas MDP cements may act similarly when combined with SA or TSC. © 2023 Japanese Association for Dental Science},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Both electrospinning and platelet-rich plasma have shown great application prospects in tissue regeneration and repair, but there are few studies on electrospun nanofiber composite scaffolds loaded with platelet-rich plasma. OBJECTIVE: To review the research progress of electrospun nanofiber composite scaffolds loaded with platelet-rich plasma in bone and soft tissue engineering in recent years, in order to provide ideas and theoretical support for further in-depth research on the clinical application of composite scaffolds. METHODS: Using “tissue engineering, platelet-rich plasma, electrospun scaffolds, stem cell, regenerative medicine” as English search terms and “tissue engineering, platelet-rich plasma, electrospinning, stem cell, tissue regeneration, bone regeneration, cartilage regeneration, soft tissue regeneration” as Chinese search terms, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Ovid, SpringerLink, Wiley Oline Library, Medline, Wanfang, and CNKI databases. Totally 64 articles were finally included for review. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) Electrospun nanoscaffolds loaded with platelet-rich plasma have the advantages of both platelet-rich plasma and electrospun nanoscaffolds, which are more elastic, less tearing, suitable mechanical strength and good biocompatibility. (2) The combination of platelet-rich plasma and three-dimensional oriented fiber scaffolds can better simulate the microenvironment of natural tissues, promote cell growth, proliferation and differentiation, and promote bone and soft tissue repair and regeneration. (3) In terms of bone tissue regeneration, it has certain compressive capacity under different stress conditions, and has good cell compatibility. (4) In terms of soft tissue regeneration, by regulating the porosity and surface area of the material, it is beneficial to cell respiration, and can promote wound healing, nerve cell growth and vascular regeneration. (5) However, due to various reasons, there are still few ideal materials that can be used in clinical practice to promote the regeneration and repair of bone and soft tissue. How to make use of the advantages of various materials and how to optimize the physical and chemical properties of various materials, so as to strengthen the interaction between scaffolds and seed cells, and maintain a high sustained-release effect on platelet-rich plasma-derived growth factor remains one of the problems to be solved in future research, which needs further in vivo research and clinical trials. © 2023, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

Curcumin was degraded by oxidizing agents including 2,2'-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride) and hydrogen peroxide, while siRNP effectively protected the encapsulated curcumin from oxidative degradation. In addition, CUR@siRNP showed significantly higher antioxidant activities in protein carbonyl assay and lipid peroxidation assay than free curcumin. Furthermore, CUR@siRNP remarkably suppressed the toxicity of curcumin against normal fibroblasts L929 cell line by using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The GI distribution in vivo showed that CUR@siRNP improved the accumulation of curcumin in the small intestine and colon after oral administration.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Our group has demonstrated that the immunomodulatory peptide DP7-C has good immunomodulatory functions and can efficiently transfect and deliver miRNAs into cells to exert regulatory functions. OBJECTIVE: To prepare and screen porous poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres of different sizes loaded with immunomodulatory peptide miR-26a complexes, construct and optimize the sustained release system, and verify its biocompatibility and osteogenic ability in vivo. METHODS: (1) Microsphere preparation: Porous poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres were prepared by double emulsification with NH4HCO3 as the pore-forming agent. Three different sizes of porous poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres were prepared by adjusting the rotational speed. The microspheres were dispersed in the solution of immunomodulatory peptide DP7-C/miR-26a complex to prepare drug-loaded microspheres. The physical properties of the microspheres were characterized. The best drug-loaded porous poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres were selected by comparing productivity, encapsulation rate and release performance for further use. (2) In vitro cell experiment: Drug-loaded and drug-free microsphere solutions with different mass concentrations were co-cultured with rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. CCK-8 assay was performed to verify biocompatibility. (3) Animal in vivo experiment: Nine adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into blank group, control group and experimental group, with three rats in each group. Cranial defect models with a diameter of 5 mm were established in all three groups. The rats of the blank group were not implanted with the material. The rats of the control group were implanted with blank microspheres. The rats of the experimental group were implanted with microspheres loaded with DP7-C/miR-26a complex. At 8 weeks after operation, the pathological morphology and immunohistochemical staining for alkaline phosphatase of the main organs and skull defects were performed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) Microsphere preparation: According to the relevant detection results, the drug-loaded microspheres prepared at 1 000 r/min compared with 500 and 1 200 r/min had uniform size, higher yield and better sustained release performance, which could be used in subsequent experiments. (2) In vitro cell experiment: CCK-8 assay results exhibited that drug-loaded and drug-free microsphere solutions had no effect on the proliferation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and had no obvious cytotoxicity. (3) In vivo experiments: There were no pathological changes in the viscera on hematoxylin-eosin staining related to the treatment with the intervention. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and Masson staining demonstrated that in the blank group, the defect site was mainly filled by fibrous connective tissue, with a small amount of angiogenesis, but without obvious new bone formation. In the control group, a small amount of new bone formation, fibrous tissue hyperplasia and new capillaries could be visible at the defect site. In the experimental group, there was obvious new bone formation, different degrees of fibrous tissue hyperplasia and new capillaries in the defect area. Immunohistochemical results displayed that alkaline phosphatase was highly expressed in the experimental group compared to the blank group and the control group (P < 0.05). (4) These findings have concluded that the porous poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/DP7-C/miR-26a composite system has good biocompatibility and in vivo osteogenic properties and can promote bone regeneration and repair of critical bone defects in the rat skull. © 2023, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

	abstract = {A composite of chitosan and chitosan with Fe3 O4 (5, 10, 15 and 20 wt%) is casted forming film. At room temperature, prepared samples were analyzed with ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Then, antimicrobial activity against different microorganisms was evaluated. ATR-FTIR results showed that the bands for chitosan/Fe3 O4 at 3250 cm-1 of the O-H band become broader compared to pure chitosan. Fe3 O4 shows bands at 3195 cm-1 and 1628 cm-1 related to O-H stretching and bending. Magnetite Fe3 O4 has two strong infrared absorption bands at 547 cm-1 and 435 cm-1. X-ray diffraction results confirmed the reaction and showed that a 10% weight percentage is the most reactive ratio consistent with FTIR results. The crystallinity index and crystallite size increase with increasing the concentration of magnetite, indicating that the samples prefer the amorphous form at the low concentrations of Fe3 O4, and they rearrange towards the crystalline state due to the presence of magnetite. Magnetic measurements showed that both saturation magnetizations (Ms) and remanent magnetizations (Mr) increase while the coercive field (Hc) first decreases and then increases as the Fe3 O4 concentration increases in the prepared nanocomposites. From antimicrobial activity against different microorganisms results, chitosan/Fe3 O4 with different weight percentages of Fe3 O4 showed strong antibacterial activity against bacterial species. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Carbon dots (CDs), as excellent antibacterial nanomaterials, have gained great attention in treating infection-induced diseases such as periodontitis and stomatitis. Given the eventual exposure of CDs to the intestine, elucidating the effect of CDs on intestinal health is required for the safety evaluation of CDs. Results: Herein, CDs extracted from ε-poly-l-lysine (PL) were chosen to explore the modulation effect of CDs on probiotic behavior in vitro and intestinal remodeling in vivo. Results verify that PL-CDs negatively regulate Lactobacillus rhamnosus (L. rhamnosus) growth via increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and reducing the antioxidant activity, which subsequently destroys membrane permeability and integrity. PL-CDs are also inclined to inhibit cell viability and accelerate cell apoptosis. In vivo, the gavage of PL-CDs is verified to induce inflammatory infiltration and barrier damage in mice. Moreover, PL-CDs are found to increase the Firmicutes to Bacteroidota (F/B) ratio and the relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae while decreasing that of Muribaculaceae. Conclusion: Overall, these evidences indicate that PL-CDs may inevitably result in intestinal flora dysbiosis via inhibiting probiotic growth and simultaneously activating intestinal inflammation, thus causing pathological damage to the intestine, which provides an effective and insightful reference for the potential risk of CDs from the perspective of intestinal remodeling. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: As nanomaterials and medical devices containing nanomaterials have unique characteristics such as small size and large specific surface area, which may lead to special biological effects, their biological safety has become the focus of attention. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the biosafety of poly(lactic acid)/nano-hydroxyapatite composite microspheres. METHODS: Poly(lactic acid)/nano-hydroxyapatite composite microspheres were prepared by emulsion solvent evaporation. (1) Cytotoxicity test: Mouse fibroblasts were co-cultured with poly(lactic acid)/nano-hydroxyapatite composite microspheres extract. Blank control (complete medium), negative control (high-density polyethylene resin extract) and positive control (zinc diethyldithiocarbamate extract) were set. The cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT assay. (2) Sensitization reaction: Polar and non-polar extraction of the sample, intradermal induction and excitation test were conducted, and the results were recorded. (3) Intradermal reaction: Polar extraction and non-polar extraction of composite microspheres were performed. Immediately, 24, 48 and 72 hours after intradermal injection, the status of each injection site was observed. (4) Acute systemic toxicity: The composite microspheres were extracted by polar extraction and non-polar extraction. After intravenous and intraperitoneal injection into the body of KM mice, the changes in body weight of mice were observed. (5) Pyrogen reaction: After polar extraction, the composite microspheres were injected through the ear vein into the rabbit to record changes in body temperature. (6) Bone implantation test: Cylindrical composite microspheres with high-density polyethylene rods were implanted into the tibial defects of rabbits for gross observation and local histopathological observation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) The poly(lactic acid)/nano-hydroxyapatite composite microspheres had no cytotoxicity, sensitization, intradermal irritation, or acute systemic toxicity. The pyrogen reaction was in line with the test regulations. After the composite microspheres were implanted into the tibial defect of rabbits, no lesions such as hematoma, edema or inflammation were observed at the implantation site, and the histological observation showed that the composite microspheres had a certain ability of bone tissue repair. (2) Bone results show that poly(lactic acid)/nano-hydroxyapatite composite microspheres had good biosafety. © 2023, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

	abstract = {Along with the recognized therapeutic outcomes of regenerative medicine, extracellular vesicles and their exosome subsets have become an alternative option for wound healing. Periplaneta americana L. (PA), an ancient and traditional medicinal insect, has been around for 300 million years, and displays magic formidable vitality and environmental adaptive ability. The linkage between intrinsic amputation regeneration feature and the acknowledged wound healing medicinal benefit of PA has never been revealed. Herein, inspired by the ability of exosomes to participate in the interkingdom communication, we explored whether this effect was ascribed to PA derived exosome-like nanoparticles (PA-ELNs). PA-ELNs were extracted by differential velocity centrifugation approach and characterized by DLS, NTA and TEM. Their cargoes were analyzed by LC-MS/MS proteomics and small RNA-seq analysis. The wound healing activity was verified in vivo and in vitro. PA-ELNs with a concentration of 2.33x109±6.35x107 particles/mL exhibited a lipid bilayer-bound membrane structure with an average size of 104.7 nm. Furthermore, the miRNA cargoes in PA-ELNs participate in some wound healing related signal pathways such as TGF-beta, mTOR, and autophagy. As expected, the in vitro tests indicated that PA-ELNs were apt to be internalized in HUVECs, L929 and RAW 264.7 cells and contributed to cell proliferation and migration. Most importantly, we demonstrated that the topical administration of PA-ELNs could remarkably accelerate wound healing in a diabetic mouse model, and was involved in anti-inflammatory, re-epithelialization and autophagy regulation. This study provides clear evidence for the first time that PA-ELNs, as diabetic wound healing accelerators, are the “bioactive code” of this ancient medicinal insect.

	abstract = {Increasing risks of incidental and occupational exposures to two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDCs) due to their broad application in various areas raised their public health concerns. While the composition-dependent cytotoxicity of 2D TMDCs has been well-recognized, how the outer chalcogenide atoms and inner transition metal atoms differentially contribute to their perturbation on cell homeostasis at non-lethal doses remains to be identified. In the present work, we compared the autophagy induction and related mechanisms in response to WS2, NbS2, WSe2 and NbSe2 nanosheets exposures in MH-S murine alveolar macrophages. All these 2D TMDCs had comparable physicochemical properties, overall cytotoxicity and capability in triggering autophagy in MH-S cells, but showed outer chalcogen-dependent subcellular localization and activation of autophagy pathways. Specifically, WS2 and NbS2 nanosheets adhered on the cell surface and internalized in the lysosomes, and triggered mTOR-dependent activation of autophagy. Meanwhile, WSe2 and NbSe2 nanosheets had extensive distribution in cytoplasm of MH-S cells and induced autophagy in an mTOR-independent manner. Furthermore, the 2D TMDCs-induced perturbation on autophagy aggravated the cytotoxicity of respirable benzo[a]pyrene. These findings provide a deeper insight into the potential health risk of environmental 2D TMDCs from the perspective of homeostasis perturbation. © 2023},

	abstract = {Oral colonic nano-drug delivery system has attracted growing attention in treating colon cancer for their excellent characteristics. However, the unique and complex structure of the gastrointestinal tract is still an obstacle to the safe delivery of drugs targeting sites in colon tumors. Here, we designed magnetically driven dual-targeted oral colonic nanoparticles loaded with chlorogenic acid using pectin and oleic acid-modified iron oxide (Fe3O4@OA). Specific degradation of pectin by pectinase produced by colonic flora and magnetic fields applied to the colon confers specific targeting of nanoparticles to the colon. In order to overcome the challenge of preparing magnetically driven nanoparticles with small and homogeneous particle sizes by a single conventional method, we developed the combined ultrasound-emulsification technique. The average particle size of the prepared nanoparticles was 81.04 ± 1.02 nm, which showed good drug release in the simulated colonic environment. In vitro anticancer studies, the drug-loaded nanoparticles possess an obvious toxicity and apoptosis-inducing ability against cancer cells. Meanwhile, the hemolysis results demonstrated the safety of the nanoplatform (PET/CGA/Fe3O4@OA). This work holds broad prospects as a new treatment modality for colon cancer. © 2023},

	abstract = {The importance of heat transfer in nanoliquids cannot avoided because it playing crucial role in the applied research fields. The potential area of applications included but restricted to applied thermal, biomedical, mechanical and chemical engineering. Therefore, it is the need of time to introduce new efficient way to enhance the heat transport rate in common fluids. The major aim of this research is to develop a new heat transport BHNF (Biohybrid Nanofluid Model) model in a channel having expanding/contracting walls up to Newtonian regimes of blood. The two sort of nanomaterials (Graphene + CuO) along with blood as base solvent are taken for the formation of working fluid. After that, the model analyzed via VIM (Variational Iteration Method) to examine the influence of involved physical parameters on the behavior of bionanofluids. The model results revealed that the bionanofluids velocity rises towards the lower and upper channel end when the expanding/contracting of the walls in the range of 0.1–1.6 (expanding case) and -0.1 to 1.6 (contraction case). The working fluid attained high velocity in the neighboring of center portion of the channel. By increasing the walls permeability (A1= 0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4 ), the fluid movement can be reduced and optimum decrement observed about η= 0.0 . Further, inclusion of thermal radiation (Rd) and temperature coefficient (θr ) observed good to enhance thermal mechanism in both hybrid and simple bionanofluids. The present ranges of Rd and θr considered from 0.1 to 0.9 and 0.1 to 1.4 , respectively.

	abstract = {Aging of the global population increases the incidence of osteoporosis and associated fragility fractures, significantly impacting patient quality of life and healthcare costs. The acute inflammatory reaction is essential to initiate healing after injury. However, aging is associated with “inflammaging”, referring to the presence of systemic low-level chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation impairs the initiation of bone regeneration in elderly patients. This review examines current knowledge of the bone regeneration process and potential immunomodulatory therapies to facilitate bone healing in inflammaging. Aged macrophages show increased sensitivity and responsiveness to inflammatory signals. While M1 macrophages are activated during the acute inflammatory response, proper resolution of the inflammatory phase involves repolarizing pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype associated with tissue regeneration. In aging, persistent chronic inflammation resulting from the failure of M1 to M2 repolarization leads to increased osteoclast activation and decreased osteoblast formation, thus increasing bone resorption and decreasing bone formation during healing. Inflammaging can impair the ability of stem cells to support bone regeneration and contributes to the decline in bone mass and strength that occurs with aging. Therefore, modulating inflammaging is a promising approach for improving bone health in the aging population. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess immunomodulatory properties that may benefit bone regeneration in inflammation. Preconditioning MSCs with pro-inflammatory cytokines affects MSCs’ secretory profile and osteogenic ability. MSCs cultured under hypoxic conditions show increased proliferation rates and secretion of growth factors. Resolution of inflammation via local delivery of anti-inflammatory cytokines is also a potential therapy for bone regeneration in inflammaging. Scaffolds containing anti-inflammatory cytokines, unaltered MSCs, and genetically modified MSCs can also have therapeutic potential. MSC exosomes can increase the migration of MSCs to the fracture site and enhance osteogenic differentiation and angiogenesis. In conclusion, inflammaging can impair the proper initiation of bone regeneration in the elderly. Modulating inflammaging is a promising approach for improving compromised bone healing in the aging population. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a common rheumatic disorder distinguished by chronic inflammation and heterotopic ossification at local entheses sites. Currently available medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and TNF inhibitors, are limited by side effects, high costs and unclear inhibitory effects on heterotopic ossification. Herein, we developed manganese ferrite nanoparticles modified by the aptamer CH6 (CH6-MF NPs) that can efficiently scavenge ROS and actively deliver siRNA into hMSCs and osteoblasts in vivo for effective AS treatment. CH6-MF NPs loaded with BMP2 siRNA (CH6-MF-Si NPs) effectively suppressed abnormal osteogenic differentiation under inflammatory conditions in vitro. During their circulation and passive accumulation in inflamed joints in the Zap70 mut mouse model, CH6-MF-Si NPs attenuated local inflammation and rescued heterotopic ossification in the entheses. Thus, CH6-MF NPs may be an effective inflammation reliever and osteoblast-specific delivery system, and CH6-MF-Si NPs have potential for the dual treatment of chronic inflammation and heterotopic ossification in AS. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Contaminations associated with plastics and plastic products are more prevalent worldwide. To overcome the biohazards of plastics, an alternative to plastics is warranted. Bioplastics are a good replacement for synthetic plastic polymers. Several microbes are explored for bioplastic production, and genetic engineering techniques are used to modify the isolate to produce more PHA. To overcome the production cost involved in bioplastic production, cheap household wastes are extensively used to make a variety of polyhydroxyalkonates (PHA) based bioplastics. PHA and polyhydroxybutyrates (PHB) form a part of biomaterials that finds extensive biomedical applications, including tissue repair, regenerative medicine, wound healing, cartilage regeneration, artificial blood vessels, heart valves, and nerve conduits. It is also used in organ reconstruction, including scaffold making, bone implant, implant coatings, and sheath making. It also finds application in drug delivery, cancer treatment, and stem cell engineering. Most of the applications required in-depth in vivo studies to be used for human health care applications. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Nanocellulose has recently gained a foothold of significance among nanomaterials due to its unique properties, including renewability and sustainability. In this study, two promising methods, steam explosion and alkali-acid hydrolysis, were evaluated for the cellulose extraction from coconut husk fiber. Between the two methods, alkali-acid hydrolysis yielded 1.8 times higher cellulose content than the other. Hence, cellulose was obtained through the alkali-acid hydrolysis method to synthesize Nano-Crystalline Cellulose (NCC). In order to maximize cellulose content in nanocellulose synthesis, acid concentration, reaction temperature, and hydrolysis time were optimized using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The optimum reaction condition for the synthesis of NCC was 50 °C with 45 wt% acid concentration for 60 minutes due to its high cellulose content (85.6 %). Synthesized NCC was spherical in shape with a diameter below 40 nm. NCC had better crystallinity (80.05 %) with a high zeta potential of-72.2 mV. NCC was evaluated for its adsorption capacity for different dyes at varying pH levels. Among the dyes, the removal efficiency of NCC was higher for methylene blue (90.89 %) and congo red (89.96 %) at all pH levels. But adsorption of crystal violet dye by NCC was higher in alkaline pH (9) and methyl red in acidic pH (5). As a result, synthesized nano cellulose could be used in the removal of synthetic dyes from textile effluents. © 2022 by the authors.},

Here we investigate the kinetics of inflammatory cells from day (D)1 to D180 after mouse hindlimb irradiation and analyze the role of monocyte (Mo) subsets in tissue revascularization. At D1, we find that Mo and T cells are mobilized from spleen and bone marrow to the blood. New vessel formation during early phase, as demonstrated by ~1.4- and 2-fold increased angiographic score and capillary density, respectively, correlates with an increase of circulating T cells, and Mohi and type 1-like macrophages in irradiated muscle. At D90 vascular rarefaction and cachexia are observed, associated with decreased numbers of circulating Molo and Type 2-like macrophages in irradiated tissue. Moreover, CCR2- and CX3CR1-deficency negatively influences neovascularization. However adoptive transfer of Mohi enhances vessel growth.

This study investigated the biological mechanisms of the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of human periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) induced by GQDs in an inflammatory microenvironment. Materials and methods: PDLSCs were cultured in osteogenic-induced medium with various concentrations of GQDs in standard medium or medium mimicking a proinflammatory environment. The effects of GQDs on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation activity of PDLSCs were tested by CCK-8 assay, Alizarin Red S staining, and qRT‒PCR. In addition, Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway-related gene expression was measured by qRT‒PCR. Results: Compared with the control group, the mRNA expression levels of ALP, RUNX2, and OCN and the number of mineralized nodules were all increased in PDLSCs after treatment with GQDs. Moreover, during the osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs, the expression levels of LRP6 and β-catenin, which are Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway-related genes, were upregulated.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The process of tendon-bone healing after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with allografts is complex, and tunnel enlargement may occur due to poor healing. The process of preoperative graft treatment may have some influence on tendon-bone healing, but the specific situation is not clear. OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of allograft disposal methods on bone remodeling during tendon-bone healing after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery. METHODS: Thirty-two male beagles were randomly divided into four groups (n=8 per group) for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by coin toss method after establishing bilateral posterior cruciate ligament rupture models. In group A, fresh autogenous Achilles tendon grafts were used. In group B, a fresh allograft Achilles tendon was used. In group C, an allograft Achilles tendon irradiated by gamma rays and refrigerated at low temperature was used. In group D, lyophilized allograft tendon after γ-ray irradiation was used. Micro CT scanning and osteoclast tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining were performed in the femor-graft-tibia complex at 3 and 6 months after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Scanning images were selected to measure the bone microstructural parameters and a 3D bone tunnel model was established to measure the tunnel area. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) Micro CT scan: 3 months after operation, the connection density, trabecular number, trabecular thickness, ratio of bone volume to total volume and structural model index in group D were lower than those in groups A and C (P < 0.05). The trabecular separation was higher in group D than that of group A (P < 0.05). The connection density, trabecular number and structural model index of group B were lower than those of group A (P < 0.05). The trabecular separation was higher in group B than that in group A (P < 0.05). The ratio of bone volume to total volume was lower in group B than that in groups A and C (P < 0.05). Six months after surgery, the connection density, trabecular number and the ratio of bone volume to total volume in group D were lower than those in group A (P < 0.05). Trabecular thickness and structural model index were lower in group D than those in groups A and C (P < 0.05). The trabecular separation was higher in group D than that in group A (P < 0.05). The connection density and structural model index of group B were lower than those of group A (P < 0.05). The trabecular thickness was lower in group B than that in groups A and C (P < 0.05). The trabecular separation was higher in group B than that in group A (P < 0.05). (2) Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining: Compared with group A, osteoclasts in groups B and D were stained more deeply and more in number. The osteoclasts in group C were similar to those in group A in morphology and quantity, with small volume and light staining. (3) Tunnel area: At the same time point, the tunnel expansion of the femur and tibia in group D was the largest. The area of the inner opening of the tibial tunnel at 3 months after operation and the area of the inner opening and middle part of the femoral tunnel at 3 and 6 months after operation in group B were larger than that in group A (P < 0.05). The area of the inner opening of the tibial tunnel at 3 and 6 months after operation was larger than that of group A (P < 0.05). (4) Those findings suggest that bone tunnel enlargement is common during tendon-bone healing after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The disposal methods may affect bone resorption and the changes in bone microstructure mediated by osteoclasts at the tendon-bone interface. Therefore, it affected bone remodeling during tendon-bone healing. © 2023, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that autophagy, as a cell self-protection mechanism, plays an important role in regulating osteoblast function and maintaining osteoblast homeostasis. It has an important influence on the treatment and prognosis of periprosthetic osteolysis. OBJECTIVE: To provide new therapeutic ideas and potential therapeutic targets for periprosthetic osteolysis by summarizing previous studies on the autophagy mechanism of osteoblasts. METHODS: The first author used the computer to search the articles published from 2015 to 2022. In Chinese, the search terms “wear particles, periprosthetic osteolysis, osteoblasts, signal pathways, autophagy” were used to search the databases of CNKI, WanFang, and VIP. In English, the PubMed and Web of Science databases were retrieved with “wear debris, wear particles, peri*prosthetic osteolysis, PPOL, aseptic loosening, osteoblast, OB, signal path, autophagy”. A total of 98 articles were included according to the inclusion criteria. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) In periprosthetic osteolysis, the changes in the autophagy ability of osteoblasts induced by wear particles play a key role in the development and outcome of the disease. (2) A variety of signaling pathways jointly mediate autophagy in osteoblasts, among which the key pathways include AMPK/ULK1/mTOR, nuclear factor-κB, Pink1/Parkin, etc. AMPK, mTOR, and ULK1 can regulate each other and jointly maintain the stability of the autophagy level. There is a complex crosstalk between the nuclear factor-κB pathway and autophagy. PINK1 and Parkin are accumulated on the surface of the damaged mitochondrial membrane, inducing autophagy. (3) There is crosstalk among multiple signaling pathways, which form a complex autophagy network under their mutual influence. Moreover, the activation of the same autophagy pathway in different cells may bring about completely opposite effects. (4) Moderate autophagy induced by wear particles can reduce the apoptosis of osteoblasts, enhance their differentiation and mineralization ability, and improve the prognosis of osteolysis around the prosthesis. On the contrary, insufficient or excessive activation of autophagy will cause damage to osteoblasts and promote the progress of osteolysis. Therefore, targeting the level of autophagy of osteoblasts induced by wear particles through drugs or genes may be one of the directions for the treatment of periprosthetic osteolysis. © 2023, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

	abstract = {The Bi-doped zinc oxide (Bi-ZnO) nanostructured was elaborated on the indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) substrate by electrodeposition. The bath temperature was performed at 70°C. The films were cathodically electrodeposited in a bath containing 0.01mol.L-1 Zn(NO3)2. 6H2O, while the source of doping is Bi(NO3 )3. 5H2O and 0.1 mol.L-1 KNO3 was used as supporting electrolyte. Our interest is to study the influence of doping on the mechanism of electrodeposition and the structural and optical properties of these layers. The cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry investigation shows that the electrodeposition of ZnO and Bi ZnO doped at a negative potential around −1.1 V versus Ag/AgCl is a quasi-reversible reaction controlled by the diffusion process. Current transient curves measured showed that the nucleation mechanism of ZnO and Bi-doped ZnO is instantaneous with three-dimensional growth of hemispherical nuclei. XRD patterns show that ZnO and Bi-doped ZnO on the ITO substrate crystallizes in a hexagonal würtzite-like structure. UV-Visible transmission spectrum affirms that good transparent films of Bi-doped ZnO cannot be obtained. SEM analysis revealed that the morphology of the obtained deposits depends on the type of electrodeposition mechanism. © 2023 by the authors.},

The tests with FTIR, SEM, TG, and X-ray diffractometer showed that the coordination among KHA, CMC, and Fe3+ formed a three-dimensional network structure, where CS was encapsulated on the surface of the hydrogel spheres via noncovalent bonding, resulting in good thermal stability. The stability, drug loading, swelling, and in vitro release of the (KHA/CMC-Fe3+)@CS hydrogel spheres were investigated. The results showed that the hydrogel spheres were significantly pH-sensitive, with 11.16 g/g higher swelling in an alkaline environment (pH = 7.4) than that in an acidic environment (pH = 1.2). The swelling and drug release process of the hydrogel spheres were analyzed using mathematical models, concluding that the hydrogel swelling follows Schott second-order swelling kinetics, and the drug release mechanism was Fickian delivery mode. © 2023 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences},

The DLC thin films were partially deposited on stretched polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates covered with a metal mask by the plasma chemical vaper deposition method, and using the substrates culture teats with human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) were performed. Three patterns of interconnection structures of axons were created on the substrates with disordered and regular linear wrinkle structures with several μm size formed by the depositions. The patterns were characterized by the structure that the aggregations of axons formed on the linear DLC thin film deposited areas were separately placed in regular intervals and connected each other by plenty of axons, which were individually taut in a straight line at about 100 to over 200 μm in length. The substrates expected of uses for evaluation of axon behaviors are available without fabricating guiding grooves by conventional soft lithographic methods requiring multiple stages and their treating times. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Localized corrosion can be initiated by survival pits under sufficient conditions of the breakdown passive films.

	abstract = {Functional unit of many organs like lung, kidney, intestine, and eye have their endothelial and epithelial monolayers physically separated by a specialized extracellular matrix called the basement membrane. The intricate and complex topography of this matrix influences cell function, behavior and overall homeostasis. In vitro barrier function replication of such organs requires mimicking of these native features on an artificial scaffold system. Apart from chemical and mechanical features, the choice of nano-scale topography of the artificial scaffold is integral, however its influence on monolayer barrier formation is unclear. Though studies have reported improved single cell adhesion and proliferation in presence of pores or pitted topology, corresponding influence on confluent monolayer formation is not well reported. In this work, basement membrane mimic with secondary topographical cues is developed and its influence on single cells and their monolayers is investigated. We show that single cells cultured on fibers with secondary cues form stronger focal adhesions and undergo increased proliferation. Counterintuitively, absence of secondary cues promoted stronger cell–cell interaction in endothelial monolayers and promoted formation of integral tight barriers in alveolar epithelial monolayers. Overall, this work highlights the importance of choice of scaffold topology to develop basement barrier function in in vitro models. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Type H blood vessels, a specific subtype of vessels newly discovered in recent years, have been identified to couple angiogenesis and osteogenesis. They play an important role in the physiological and pathological processes of the skeletal system. Natural small molecular compounds have the advantages of widespread sources, low toxic and side effects. In recent years, studies have found that natural small molecular compounds can regulate type H blood vessels. OBJECTIVE: To review the basic characteristics of type H blood vessels and discuss the application status and prospect of several natural small molecular compounds in the treatment of bone-related diseases. METHODS: The literature search was performed in Web of Science, PubMed, CNKI and WanFang databases. Relevant articles published from January 2014 to June 2022 were researched with the key words of “type H vessel, natural small molecular compounds, natural small molecule drugs, active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine” in Chinese and “type H vessel, H-type vessel, type H microvessel, type H blood vessel, CD31hiEmcnhi endothelial cell, CD31hiEndomucinhi blood vessel, CD31(hi)Emcn(hi) endothelial cell, specific vessel subtype, natural small molecular compounds, Chinese medicine, Chinese traditional medicine, Chinese plant extracts” in English. After reading the titles and abstracts, repetitive studies, low-quality or irrelevant articles were excluded. Finally, 65 articles were included for review. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) Type H vessel is a special subtype of blood vessels mainly found in the metaphysis and endosteum of long bones, and also exist in other types of bones. At most sites, type H vessels are arranged linearly with a distinctive columnar or palisade-like structure. Moreover, type H blood vessels have significant age-related changes in length and abundance of vascular buds. (2) Type H vessels play an important role in couple angiogenic and osteogenic processes via blood flow as well as the recruitment and regulation of osteoblasts lineage and osteoclast lineage. (3) Type H vessels are important in the occurrence and development of bone disease. Natural small molecular compounds show a good prospect in the study of treating bone-related diseases including osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, bone fracture, and unloading-induced bone loss via regulating type H blood vessels. For example, diterbutyl phthalate, the extract of Panax notoginseng, blunted the aberrant formation of type H vessels to prevent osteoarthritis progression. Ginsenoside compound K, the extract of Panax ginseng, can promote the formation of type H vessels in callus and accelerate fracture healing. (4) In view of the prospective effect of tissue engineering scaffolds loading drugs and cytokines on type H blood vessels in the treatment of bone diseases and natural small molecular compounds in regulating type H blood vessels, the combination of tissue engineering scaffolds and natural small molecular compounds to regulate type H blood vessels is a potential strategy. © 2023, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

Here we report a biological tissue-inspired ultrasoft microfiber composite ultrathin (< 5 μm) hydrogel film, which is currently the thinnest hydrogel film as far as we know. The embedded microfibers endow the composite hydrogel with prominent mechanical strength (tensile stress ~ 6 MPa) and anti-tearing property. Moreover, our microfiber composite hydrogel offers the capability of tunable mechanical properties in a broad range, allowing for matching the modulus of most biological tissues and organs. The incorporation of glycerol and salt ions imparts the microfiber composite hydrogel with high ionic conductivity and prominent anti-dehydration behavior.

	abstract = {This paper describes an image processing-based technique used to measure the volume of residual water in the drinking water bottle for the laboratory mouse. This technique uses a camera to capture the bottle's image and then processes the image to calculate the volume of water in the bottle. Firstly, the Grabcut method separates the foreground and background to avoid the influence of background on image feature extraction. Then Canny operator was used to detect the edge of the water bottle and the edge of the liquid surface. The cumulative probability Hough detection identified the water bottle edge line segment and the liquid surface line segment from the edge image. Finally, the spatial coordinate system is constructed, and the length of each line segment on the water bottle is calculated by using plane analytical geometry. Then the volume of water is calculated. By comparing image processing time, the pixel number of liquid level, and other indexes, the optimal illuminance and water bottle color were obtained. The experimental results show that the average deviation rate of this method is less than 5%, which significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of measurement compared with traditional manual measurement. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Green microalgae is a possible feedstock for the production of biofuels, chemicals, food/feed, and medical products. Large-scale microalgae production requires large quantities of water and nutrients, directing the attention to wastewater as a cultivation medium. Wastewater-cultivated microalgae could via wet thermochemical conversion be valorised into products for e.g., water treatment. In this study, hydrothermal carbonization was used to process microalgae polycultures grown in municipal wastewater. The objective was to perform a systematic examination of how carbonization temperature, residence time, and initial pH affected solid yield, composition, and properties. Carbonization temperature, time and initial pH all had statistically significant effects on hydrochar properties, with temperature having the most pronounced effect; the surface area increased from 8.5 to 43.6 m2 g−1 as temperature was increased from 180 to 260 °C. However, hydrochars produced at low temperature and initially neutral pH generally had the highest capacity for methylene blue adsorption. DRIFTS analysis of the hydrochar revealed that the pH conditions changed the functional group composition, implying that adsorption was electrostatic interactions driven. This study concludes that un-activated hydrochars from wastewater grown microalgae produced at relatively low hydrothermal carbonization temperatures adsorb methylene blue, despite having low surface area. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the in-depth research and rapid development of tissue engineering, tissue-engineered scaffolds provide a new opportunity for bone tissue repair. OBJECTIVE: To explore the cell proliferation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells after co-culture with the magnesium-based alloy scaffolds, to provide a new idea for the construction of tissue-engineered bone scaffolds and provide a basis for the clinical application of tissue-engineered scaffolds. METHODS: The bone marrow fluid of rabbits was extracted under sterile conditions. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were cultured and isolated by the whole bone marrow adherent method. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were identified by flow cytometry and osteogenic differentiation ability was tested. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells at passage 3 were seeded on magnesium-based alloy scaffolds and chitosan polycaprolactone tricalcium phosphate scaffolds respectively. The cell growth was observed by laser confocal scanning on days 3 and 10, and cell proliferation was detected using an MTT assay on days 1, 4, 7, 10 and 14, respectively. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) The cultured cells highly expressed CD44 and CD90, but hardly CD34. (2) The morphology gradually changed to polygonal after osteogenesis induction. Von Kossa staining showed that the calcium nodules between the cells were stained black, and the alkaline phosphatase activity was significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05). (3) After co-culture of magnesium-based alloy and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, confocal scanning showed that the cells could adhere to the scaffold and grow in clusters. With the extension of time, the magnesium-based alloy scaffold was more active in proliferation than the seed cells loaded on the chitosan polycaprolactone tricalcium phosphate scaffold, and the number of cells was significantly increased. MTT assay showed that when the two materials were co-cultured with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells for 10 days, the cell growth reached its peak. (4) These results indicate that rabbit-derived bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells have a good osteogenic potential. After co-cultured with magnesium-based alloy scaffolds, the cells adhered and grew well on the surface of the scaffolds, indicating that the tissue-engineered magnesium-based implants were successfully constructed. © 2023, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

The spectrochemical data indicate that the synthesized ligand is tridentate in nature. The antimicrobial, anti-diabetes (A-DM), and anti-mycobacterium tuberculosis (M-TB) activities against ligands and their metal complexes were screened. The complexes exhibited enhanced bio-efficiency inhibitory results when compared to the HTDP. Excess nitrate poses harmful effects on the ecological system and causes the blue baby syndrome. The modified glassy carbon electrode prepared using [Co(HTDP)2] is used for electrochemical sensing of nitrate under different concentrations and displayed good electro-catalytic activity with long linear range (10-80 µmolL-1), sensitivity (0.172 μAμM−1 cm-2) and the LOD (limit of detection) found to be 3.333 µML-1 in PBS (pH 7) Further, the prepared sensor has more stability and showed less pouling property. © 2023 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most severe complications of diabetes mellitus, which is characterized by early occurrence of albuminuria and end-stage glomerulosclerosis. Senescence and autophagy of podocytes play an important role in DN development. Human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs) have potential in the treatment of diabetes and its complications. However, the role of hucMSCs in the treatment of DN and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. Methods: In vivo, a streptozotocin-induced diabetic male Sprague Dawley rat model was established to determine the renoprotective effect of hucMSCs on DN by biochemical analysis, histopathology, and immunohistochemical staining of renal tissues. And the distribution of hucMSCs in various organs in rats within 168 h was analyzed. In vitro, CCK8 assay, wound healing assay, and β-galactosidase staining were conducted to detect the beneficial effects of hucMSCs on high glucose-induced rat podocytes. Real-time PCR and western blot assays were applied to explore the mechanism of action of hucMSCs. Results: The in vivo data revealed that hucMSCs were distributed into kidneys and significantly protected kidneys from diabetic damage. The in vitro data indicated that hucMSCs improved cell viability, wound healing, senescence of the high glucose-damaged rat podocytes through a paracrine action mode. Besides, the altered expressions of senescence-associated genes (p16, p53, and p21) and autophagy-associated genes (Beclin-1, p62, and LC3) were improved by hucMSCs. Mechanistically, hucMSCs protected high glucose-induced injury in rat podocytes by activating autophagy and attenuating senescence through the AMPK/mTOR pathway. Conclusions: In conclusion, hucMSCs might be a promising therapeutic strategy for the clinical treatment of DN-induced renal damages. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Certain chemotherapeutics can induce tumor cells’ immunogenic cell death (ICD), release tumor antigens, and thereby trigger personalized antitumor immune responses. Co-delivery of adjuvants using nanocarriers could amplify the ICD-induced tumor-specific immunity achieving a synergistic chemo-immunotherapeutic effect. However, complicated preparation, low drug loading efficiency, and potential carrier-associated toxicity are the major challenges that limited its clinical applications. Herein, a carrier-free core–shell nanoparticle (MPLA-CpG-sMMP9-DOX, MCMD NPs) was constructed by facile self-assembly of spherical nucleic acids (SNA) with two adjuvants of CpG ODN and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) as a core and doxorubicin (DOX) radially around the dual-adjuvants SNA as a shell. The results demonstrated that MCMD NPs could enhance drugs accumulation in tumors, and release DOX upon enzymatic degradation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) peptide in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which enhanced the direct-killing effect of DOX on tumor cells. The core of MPLA-CpG SNA efficiently boosted the ICD-induced antitumor immune response to further attack tumor cells. Thus, MCMD NPs achieved a synergistic therapeutic effect of chemo-immunotherapy with reduced off-target toxicity. This study provided an efficient strategy for the development of a carrier-free nano-delivery system for enhanced cancer chemo-immunotherapy. © 2023, The Author(s).},
