	abstract = {Nano-HAp and ZnO-containing particles in the main chitosan matrix that can be used as a scaffold composite or surface coating in dental and medical implants to improve infection and biocompatibility processes have been developed. After adding chitosan/HAp-ZnO biopolymer, a cross-linked triple absorbent composite system was produced using glutaraldehyde simply and practically. Morphological analyzes were examined by FE-SEM analysis, and the changes that occurred with the cross-linking reaction were observed. Elemental analysis of composite materials was analyzed with EDS, and chemical analyzes were analyzed using ART-IR, XPS XRD and Raman analyses. In addition, the thermal properties of the composites were examined by DTA and TGA analysis. As a result of the cross-linking reaction, it was observed that the composite exhibited a more compact structure. The study's primary purpose was to observe the ability of the biodegradable chitosan polymer to form composites with ZnO and HAp structure and examine the changes that occur with the cross-linking reaction. As a result, it was seen that the three components were well distributed among each other, intramolecular and intermolecular bonds were formed between these components, and the composite was restructured with the occurrence of strong interaction. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Immunology research has focused on developing cancer vaccines to increase the number of tumor-specific effector cells and their ability to fight cancer over the last few decades. There is a lack of professional success in vaccines compared to checkpoint blockade and adoptive T-cell treatment. The vaccine’s inadequate delivery method and antigen selection are most likely to blame for the poor results. Antigen-specific vaccines have recently shown promising results in preclinical and early clinical investigations. To target particular cells and trigger the best immune response possible against malignancies, it is necessary to design a highly efficient and secure delivery method for cancer vaccines; however, enormous challenges must be overcome. Current research is focused on developing stimulus-responsive biomaterials, which are a subset of the range of levels of materials, to enhance therapeutic efficacy and safety and better regulate the transport and distribution of cancer immunotherapy in vivo. A concise analysis of current developments in the area of biomaterials that respond to stimuli has been provided in brief research. Current and anticipated future challenges and opportunities in the sector are also highlighted. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Cashew tree gum is a polysaccharide material highly available in the Northeast region of Brazil. It has been explored for biocompatibility with human tissues. This research aimed to describe the synthesis and characterization of cashew gum/hydroxyapatite scaffold and evaluate the possible cytotoxicity in murine adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) cultures. ADSCs of the subcutaneous fat tissue of Wistar rats were collected, isolated, expanded, differentiated into three strains, and characterized immunophenotypically. The scaffolds were synthesized through chemical precipitation, lyophilized and characterized through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal analysis (TG and DTG), and mechanical testing. The scaffold presented a crystalline structure and pores with an average diameter of 94.45 ± 50.57 μm. By mechanical tests, the compressive force and modulus of elasticity were like the cancellous bone. The isolated adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) presented fibroblast morphology, adhesion capacity to plastic, differentiation in osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages, positive expression for the CD105 and CD90 markers and negative expression for the CD45 and CD14 markers. The MTT test showed increased cell viability, and the biomaterial showed a high level of hemocompatibility (<5 %). This study allowed the development of a new scaffold for future surgical applicability in tissue regeneration. © 2023},

The wetting properties of the coatings were examined through contact angle and 3D morphological analysis. The coatings were characterized using SEM-EDS and XRD. The results showed that the adhesion resistance of all coatings was significantly higher than the expected adhesion strength for biomaterial coatings, while their corrosion resistance was higher compared to the uncoated alloy.

	abstract = {The majority of bone and joint infections are caused by Gram-positive organisms, specifically staphylococci. Additionally, gram-negative organisms such as E. coli can infect various organs through infected wounds. Fungal arthritis is a rare condition, with examples including Mucormycosis (Mucor rhizopus). These infections are difficult to treat, making the use of novel antibacterial materials for bone diseases crucial. Sodium titanate nanotubes (NaTNTs) were synthesized using the hydrothermal method and characterized using a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM), High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), and Zeta sizer. The antibacterial and antifungal activity of the NaTNT framework nanostructure was evaluated using Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC), Disc Diffusion assays for bacterial activity, and Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC) for antifungal investigation. In addition to examining in vivo antibacterial activity in rats through wound induction and infection, pathogen counts and histological examinations were also conducted. In vitro and in vivo tests revealed that NaTNT has substantial antifungal and antibacterial effects on various bone-infected pathogens. In conclusion, current research indicates that NaTNT is an efficient antibacterial agent against a variety of microbial pathogenic bone diseases. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Mesenchymal stem cell-based therapy has become an effective therapeutic approach for bone regeneration. However, there are still limitations in successful clinical translation. Recently, the secretome of mesenchymal stem cells, especially exosome, plays a critical role in promoting bone repair and regeneration. Exosomes are nanosized, lipid bilayer-enclosed structures carrying proteins, lipids, RNAs, metabolites, growth factors, and cytokines and have attracted great attention for their potential application in bone regenerative medicine. In addition, preconditioning of parental cells and exosome engineering can enhance the regenerative potential of exosomes for treating bone defects. Moreover, with recent advancements in various biomaterials to enhance the therapeutic functions of exosomes, biomaterial-assisted exosomes have become a promising strategy for bone regeneration. This review discusses different insights regarding the roles of exosomes in bone regeneration and summarizes the applications of engineering exosomes and biomaterial-assisted exosomes as safe and versatile bone regeneration agent delivery platforms.

However, there exist no methods that could provide uniform and effective coatings for medical devices with complex shapes and materials to prevent immune-related side effects and thrombosis when they encounter biological tissues. Here, we report a lubricant skin (L-skin), a coating method based on the application of thin layers of bio-adhesive and lubricant-swellable perfluoropolymer that impart anti-biofouling, frictionless, robust, and heat-mediated self-healing properties. We demonstrate biocompatible, mechanically robust, and sterilization-safe L-skin in applications of bioprinting, microfluidics, catheter, and long and narrow medical tubing.

	abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) is recently used to manufacture biomedical implants as the customized fabrication of the desired complex shapes is easily achievable with reduced manufacturing time and material waste. However, the poor surface quality of additively manufactured products is a major concern over biomaterials' functionality. Magnetorheological Fluid Assisted Finishing (MFAF) process is an advanced surface finishing process used to improve the workpiece surface quality without altering surface topography. Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is utilized in the presented study to fabricate biomaterials using SS316L powder, and surface quality is further enhanced through the MFAF process. However, average surface roughness (Ra) only delivers the details regarding the average altitude of peaks and depth of valleys from the central line. Therefore, kurtosis (Rku) and skewness (Rsk) analysis of the polished surface are also carried out to determine detailed surface characteristics. The bio-tribology analysis of the polished surface of the AM implant determines its sustainability inside the human body. Hence, a wear test utilizing the pin-on-disc process is performed on the finished surface to determine the efficiency of the polishing process during tribological contact of the biomaterials with the bone. Further, the improved surface roughness parameters (Ra, Rku, and Rsk) after the MFAF of AM implant's surface are also investigated with an optical profilometer and scanning electron microscope. The MFAF process produced a highly polished surface on the biomaterial and a final Ra value of 32.46 nm is attained after polishing from its initial value of 8.32 μm with a decrease in wear rate (i.e., from 9.86 × 10−5 mm3/min to 0.46 × 10−5 mm3/min). The value of kurtosis less than three (i.e., 0.79) indicates that the flat peaks are generated on the surface irregularities after MFAF. Similarly, the negative skewness (i.e., Rsk = −0.28) represents that the number of peaks is less than the valleys. It indicates that the chances of wear out of the surface irregularities from the workpiece on their tribological contact are very low. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Calcium phosphate (CaP) is a kind of eco-friendly biodegradable material chemically similar to human hard tissue like bone and teeth and is highly biocompatible. CaPs have excellent biological quality, are cheap and easy to produce, are safe, and may be approved for clinical applications quite fast. CaP materials have proven themselves, yet their future is still bright. Today’s major global public health issue is the prevalence of injury and illness brought on by bone fractures. There are a number of problems with the current treatments that call for research into better methods of dealing with bone disorders. Gene therapy has recently gained attention as a promising strategy for efficient bone repair and regeneration via the use of RNA interference (RNAi) systems to modulate gene expression in the bone microenvironment. CaP nanoparticles have been shown to be efficient transporters for biomolecules that cannot enter cells to exert their biological impacts, such as nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, antibodies, and medicines. Surface functionalization and incorporation of cargo molecules make these nanoparticles distinct from their solid counterparts. This protects against nucleases and allows for selective cellular targeting. In this overview, we looked at the fundamentals of nanoparticles of calcium phosphates, including their production techniques, physicochemical features, and applications in transfection, gene silencing, drug administration, the environment, electricity, tissue engineering, drug delivery, and biomedicine. This study is predicted to be extremely valuable and advantageous to the researcher in the future progress of the research work in therapeutic applications since it comprises very comprehensive thoughts about calcium phosphate nanoparticles. Graphical Abstract: Calcium phosphate is known to be a “super material” with improved biological qualities such as bioactivity, biodegradability, cellular function, and osteoconduction. The synthesis and fabrication of calcium phosphate by different crucial techniques in enhancing the physical and chemical properties allow it to be potential in various bioengineering fields such as drug delivery, bone regeneration, gene silencing, and electrical as well as environmental applications.

	abstract = {Bacterial infections of the lung frequently occur as a secondary infection to many respiratory viral infections and conditions, including influenza, COVID-19, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF). Currently, clinical standard treats bacterial infections of the lung with antibiotic drugs. However, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics can disrupt host microbiomes, lead to patient discomfort, and current clinical settings face the constantly increasing threat of drug-resistant bacteria. Biofilms further obstruct effective treatment due to their protective matrix layer, which shields bacteria from both the host immune system and antimicrobial drugs and subsequently promotes drug resistance. Alternative antimicrobial agents, including bacteriophages and antimicrobial peptides, have been utilized to treat drug-resistant bacteria. However, these antimicrobial agents have significant limitations pertaining to their ability to arrive at infection sites without compromised function and ability to persist over an extended period to fully treat infections. Enhanced delivery strategies present great promise in addressing these issues by using micro/nanoparticle carriers that shield antimicrobial agents in transit and result in sustained release, enhancing subsequent therapeutic effect and can even be modulated to be multi-functional to further improve recovery following bacterial infection. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Muscle necrosis and angiogenesis are two major challenges in the treatment of lower-limb ischemic diseases. In this study, a triple-functional Sr/Si-containing bioceramic/alginate composite hydrogel with simultaneous bioactivity in enhancing angiogenesis, regulating inflammation, and inhibiting muscle necrosis was designed to treat lower-limb ischemic diseases. In particular, sodium alginate, calcium silicate and strontium carbonate were used to prepare injectable hydrogels, which was gelled within 10 min. More importantly, this composite hydrogel sustainedly releases bioactive Sr2+ and SiO32− ions within 28 days. The biological activity of the bioactive ions released from the hydrogels was verified on HUVECs, SMCs, C2C12 and Raw 264.7 cells in vitro, and the therapeutic effect of the hydrogel was confirmed using C57BL/6 mouse model of femoral artery ligation in vivo. The results showed that the composite hydrogel stimulated angiogenesis, developed new collateral capillaries, and re-established the blood supply. In addition, the bioactive hydrogel directly promoted the expression of muscle-regulating factors (MyoG and MyoD) to protect skeletal muscle from necrosis, inhibited M1 polarization, and promoted M2 polarization of macrophages to reduce inflammation, thereby protecting skeletal muscle cells and indirectly promoting vascularization. Our results indicate that these bioceramic/alginate composite bioactive hydrogels are effective biomaterials for treating hindlimb ischemia and suggest that biomaterial-based approaches may have remarkable potential in treating ischemic diseases. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Bone damage may be triggered by a variety of factors, and the damaged area often requires a bone graft. Bone tissue engineering can serve as an alternative strategy for repairing large bone defects. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), the progenitor cells of connective tissue, have become an important tool for tissue engineering due to their ability to differentiate into a variety of cell types. The precise regulation of the growth and differentiation of the stem cells used for bone regeneration significantly affects the efficiency of this type of tissue engineering. During the process of osteogenic induction, the dynamics and function of localized mitochondria are altered. These changes may also alter the microenvironment of the therapeutic stem cells and result in mitochondria transfer. Mitochondrial regulation not only affects the induction/rate of differentiation, but also influences its direction, determining the final identity of the differentiated cell. To date, bone tissue engineering research has mainly focused on the influence of biomaterials on phenotype and nuclear genotype, with few studies investigating the role of mitochondria. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of researches into the role of mitochondria in MSCs differentiation and critical analysis regarding smart biomaterials that are able to “programme” mitochondria modulation was proposed. Statement of significance: This review proposed the precise regulation of the growth and differentiation of the stem cells used to seed bone regeneration. • This review addressed the dynamics and function of localized mitochondria during the process of osteogenic induction and the effect of mitochondria on the microenvironment of stem cells. • This review summarized biomaterials which affect the induction/rate of differentiation, but also influences its direction, determining the final identity of the differentiated cell through the regulation of mitochondria. © 2023 Acta Materialia Inc.},

	abstract = {Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease involving entire joint. It is often initiated from the low-grade inflammation in synovial tissue and then affects articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Multiple risk factors, such as aging, mechanical overloading, trauma, overuse, etc. are involved in OA development. Several approaches have been utilized to repair cartilage defects. Among them, biomaterials-based mesenchymal stromal cell (MSCs) therapy is considered as the most promising modality. The burgeoning material science and manufacturing technologies, such as 3D printing, allow us to mimic native articular cartilage and regulate the artificial cartilage development, regeneration and functional restoration. In this review article, we will summarize the recent progress of biomaterials combined with MSCs or chondrocytes in repairing cartilage damage induced by OA. Several typical natural and synthetic biomaterials, such as collagen, alginate, hyaluronic acid and poly(ethylene glycol), polylactide acid, polyurethane, etc. for cartilage repairing will be introduced. Moreover, critical signaling pathways associated with the progression of OA, as well as the targeted pharmacologic, genetic therapies and tissue engineering scaffolds for OA and cartilage repairing are presented. We will also provide our prospects for future directions in this active research area. © 2023},

	abstract = {A high number of cancer-related deaths (up to 90) are due to metastasis and simple definition of metastasis is new colony formation of tumor cells in a secondary site. In tumor cells, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) stimulates metastasis and invasion, and it is a common characteristic of malignant tumors. Prostate cancer, bladder cancer and renal cancer are three main types of urological tumors that their malignant and aggressive behaviors are due to abnormal proliferation and metastasis. EMT has been well-documented as a mechanism for promoting invasion of tumor cells and in the current review, a special attention is directed towards understanding role of EMT in malignancy, metastasis and therapy response of urological cancers. The invasion and metastatic characteristics of urological tumors enhance due to EMT induction and this is essential for ensuring survival and ability in developing new colonies in neighboring and distant tissues and organs. When EMT induction occurs, malignant behavior of tumor cells enhances and their tend in developing therapy resistance especially chemoresistance promotes that is one of the underlying reasons for therapy failure and patient death. The lncRNAs, microRNAs, eIF5A2, Notch-4 and hypoxia are among common modulators of EMT mechanism in urological tumors. Moreover, anti-tumor compounds such as metformin can be utilized in suppressing malignancy of urological tumors. Besides, genes and epigenetic factors modulating EMT mechanism can be therapeutically targeted for interfering malignancy of urological tumors. Nanomaterials are new emerging agents in urological cancer therapy that they can improve potential of current therapeutics by their targeted delivery to tumor site. The important hallmarks of urological cancers including growth, invasion and angiogenesis can be suppressed by cargo-loaded nanomaterials. Moreover, nanomaterials can improve chemotherapy potential in urological cancer elimination and by providing phototherapy, they mediate synergistic tumor suppression. The clinical application depends on development of biocompatible nanomaterials. © 2023},

	abstract = {The anticoagulation and hemostatic properties of blood-contacting materials are opposite lines of research, but their realization mechanisms are inspired by each other. Contact between blood and implantable biomaterials is a classic problem in tribological research, as both antithrombotic and hemostatic materials are closely associated with this problem. Thrombus formation on the surfaces of blood-contacting biomedical devices can detrimentally affect their performance and patient life, so specific surface functionalization is required. Currently, intensive research has focused on the development of super-lubricated or super-hydrophobic coatings, as well as coatings that deliver antithrombotic drugs. In addition, hemostatic biomaterials with porous structures, biochemical substances, and strongly adhesive hydrogels can be used to achieve rapid and effective hemostasis via physical or biochemical mechanisms. This article reviews methods of preparing anticoagulant coatings on material surfaces and the current status of rapid hemostatic materials. It also summarizes fundamental concepts for the design and synthesis of anticoagulant and hemostatic materials by discussing thrombosis and hemostasis mechanisms in biomedical devices and normal organisms. Because there are relatively few reports reviewing the progress in surface-functionalized design for anticoagulation and hemostasis, it is anticipated that this review can provide a useful summary of the applications of both bio-adhesion and bio-lubrication techniques in the field of biomedical engineering.

	abstract = {Background: The immune system interacts with cancer cells in various intricate ways that can protect the individual from overproliferation of cancer cells; however, these interactions can also lead to malignancy. There has been a dramatic increase in the application of cancer immunotherapy in the last decade. However, low immunogenicity, poor specificity, weak presentation efficiency, and off-target side effects still limit its widespread application. Fortunately, advanced biomaterials effectively contribute immunotherapy and play an important role in cancer treatment, making it a research hotspot in the biomedical field. Main body: This review discusses immunotherapies and the development of related biomaterials for application in the field. The review first summarizes the various types of tumor immunotherapy applicable in clinical practice as well as their underlying mechanisms. Further, it focuses on the types of biomaterials applied in immunotherapy and related research on metal nanomaterials, silicon nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, polymer nanoparticles, and cell membrane nanocarriers. Moreover, we introduce the preparation and processing technologies of these biomaterials (liposomes, microspheres, microneedles, and hydrogels) and summarize their mechanisms when applied to tumor immunotherapy. Finally, we discuss future advancements and shortcomings related to the application of biomaterials in tumor immunotherapy. Conclusion: Research on biomaterial-based tumor immunotherapy is booming; however, several challenges remain to be overcome to transition from experimental research to clinical application. Biomaterials have been optimized continuously and nanotechnology has achieved continuous progression, ensuring the development of more efficient biomaterials, thereby providing a platform and opportunity for breakthroughs in tumor immunotherapy.

In this study, a 100-year-old building in Korea, protected as a cultural heritage site, is retrofitted. Buildings currently in continuous use as cafes require improvement of low building performance due to aging materials. The energy performance and sound environment of the target building were improved by recycling café generated coffee waste. Recycled coffee waste uses a phase change material, increasing its latent heat. DesignBuilder simulation, a building energy performance analysis software, analyzed energy consumption and room temperature before and after retrofit. C10 containing 10% of the phase change material of coffee waste board showed high efficiency, saving heating energy after retrofit. After retrofit according to the material sound absorption coefficient, ODEON simulation confirmed improvement of the indoor sound environment. The measured sound pressure level was 73.95 and 75.15 dB in the 500 and 1,000 Hz frequency bands, respectively; however, after implementing improvements, the sound pressure level decreased by up to 7.39%. Reverberation time was observed as high as 1.47 s and 1.83 s for the 500 and 1000 Hz frequency bands, respectively, and decreased by up to 66.67%.

	abstract = {Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is a highly conductive, easily processable, self-healing polymer. It has been shown to be useful in bioelectronic applications, for instance, as a biointerfacing layer for studying brain activity, in biosensitive transistors, and in wearable biosensors. A green and biofriendly method for improving the mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and stability of PEDOT:PSS involves mixing the polymer with a biopolymer. Via structural changes and interactions with PEDOT:PSS, biopolymers have the potential to improve the self-healing ability, flexibility, and electrical conductivity of the composite. In this work, we fabricated novel protein-polymer multifunctional composites by mixing PEDOT:PSS with genetically programmable amyloid curli fibers produced byEscherichia coli bacteria. Curli fibers are among the stiffest protein polymers and, once isolated from bacterial biofilms, can form plastic-like thin films that heal with the addition of water. Curli-PEDOT:PSS composites containing 60% curli fibers exhibited a conductivity 4.5-fold higher than that of pristine PEDOT:PSS. The curli fibers imbued the biocomposites with an immediate water-induced self-healing ability. Further, the addition of curli fibers lowered the Young’s and shear moduli of the composites, improving their compatibility for tissue-interfacing applications. Lastly, we showed that genetically engineered fluorescent curli fibers retained their ability to fluoresce within curli-PEDOT:PSS composites. Curli fibers thus allow to modulate a range of properties in conductive PEDOT:PSS composites, broadening the applications of this polymer in biointerfaces and bioelectronics. © 2022 American Chemical Society.},

The implantation of three-dimensional (3D) biofabricated grafts into the defect site can be a promising biological one-stage solution for such lesions that can avoid different disadvantages of the alternative surgical treatment options. In this study, the short-term clinical outcome of a novel surgical technique that uses a 3D bioprinted micronized adipose tissue (MAT) graft for knee cartilage defects is assessed and the degree of incorporation of such graft types is evaluated via arthroscopic and radiological analyses. Ten patients received 3D bioprinted grafts consisting of MAT with an allogenic hyaline cartilage matrix on a mold of polycaprolactone, with or without adjunct high tibial osteotomy, and they were monitored until 12 months postoperatively. Clinical outcomes were examined with patient-reported scoring instruments that consisted of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) score and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). The graft incorporation was assessed using the Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) score. At 12 months follow-up, cartilage tissue biopsy samples were taken from patients and underwent histopathological examination. In the results, at final follow-up, the WOMAC and KOOS scores were 22.39 ± 7.7 and 79.16 ± 5.49, respectively. All scores were significantly increased at final follow-up (p < 0.0001). MOCART scores were also improved to a mean of 82.85 ± 11.49, 12 months after operation, and we observed a complete incorporation of the grafts with the surrounding cartilage. Together, this study suggests a novel regeneration technique for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis patients, with less rejection response and better efficacy. © 2023 by the authors.},

Immunotherapy provides a promising modality for inhibition and even the cure of cancer. During immunotherapy, the immunogenic cell death (ICD) of tumor cells induced by chemotherapy, radiotherapy, phototherapy, bioactive materials, and so forth, triggers a series of cellular responses by causing the release of tumor-associated antigens and damage-associated molecular patterns, which ultimately activate innate and adaptive immune responses. Among them, the ICD-induced biomaterials attract increasing conditions as a benefit of biosafety and multifunctional modifications.

Nanofiber mats were fabricated from PCL solutions containing dry yarrow extract in four concentrations (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% relative to the weight of the polymer) by using blend electrospinning method. The nanofibers were characterized for their biological, mechanical and drug release behavior. In vitro release of yarrow polyphenols from the electrospun PCL nanofibers over a period of 5 days showed the release of up to 98% of the total loaded polyphenols. The released polyphenols retained its antioxidant activity, which was determined by DPPH assay. Electrospun PCL/yarrow nanofiber mats exhibited the antibacterial effect against Staphylococcus aureus, but had no effect on the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All PCL/yarrow nanofiber mats had improved mechanical properties compared to the neat PCL nanofibers, as evident by an increase in Young's modulus of elasticity (up to 5.7 times), the tensile strength (up to 5.5 times), and the strain at break (up to 1.45 times). Based on our results, yarrow-loaded PCL nanofiber mats appeared to be multi-functional biomaterials suitable for the production of catheter-coating materials, patches, or gauzes with antibacterial and antioxidant properties. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

	abstract = {Cartilage Decellularized ExtraCellular Matrix (dECM) materials have shown promising cartilage regeneration capacity due to their chondrogenic bioactivity. However, the limited retention of ECM components and the reduced integrity of functional ECM molecules during traditional decellularization processes impair the biomimicry of these materials. The current study aims to fabricate biomimetic materials containing decellularized cartilage particles that have an intact molecular structure and native composition as biomaterial inks and hydrogels for cartilage repair. For this, we established a novel two-fraction decellularization strategy for the preparation of reconstituted dECM (rdECM) particles by mixing the two-fraction components, as well as a one-fraction decellularization strategy for the preparation of biomimetic dECM (bdECM) particles. Hyaluronic acid-tyramine (THA) hydrogels containing rdECM or bdECM particles were produced and characterized via rheological test, swelling and stability evaluation, and compression test. The results showed that our novel decellularization strategies preserved intact proteoglycans and collagen at a higher retention rate with adequate DNA removal compared to traditional methods of decellularization. The addition of rdECM or bdECM particles significantly increased the shear moduli of the THA bioinks while preserving their shear-thinning properties. bdECM particle-embedded THA hydrogels also achieved long-term stability with a swelling ratio of 70% and high retention of glycosaminoglycans and collagen after long-term incubation, while rdECM particle-embedded THA hydrogels showed unsatisfactory stability as self-standing biomaterials. Compared to pure THA hydrogels, the addition of bdECM particles significantly enhanced the compression moduli. In summary, our decellularization methods are successful in the retention of functional and intact cartilage components with high yield. Both rdECM and bdECM particles can be supplemented in THA bioinks for biomimetic cartilage 3D printing. Hydrogels with cartilage bdECM particles possess the functional structure and the natural composition of cartilage ECM, long-term stability, and enhanced mechanical properties, and are promising biomaterials for cartilage repair. © 2023},

Although semi-synthesis strategies such as utilizing recombinant E. coli or yeast expression systems have been explored as alternative methods, the influence of unwanted by-products, foreign substances, and immature synthetic processes have limited its industrial production and clinical applications. Meanwhile, macromolecule collagen products encounter a bottleneck in delivery and absorption by conventional oral and injection vehicles, which promotes the studies of transdermal and topical delivery strategies and implant methods.

	abstract = {The use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for clinical purposes has skyrocketed in the past decade. Their multilineage differentiation potentials and immunomodulatory properties have facilitated the discovery of therapies for various illnesses. MSCs can be isolated from infant and adult tissue sources, which means they are easily available. However, this raises concerns because of the heterogeneity among the various MSC sources, which limits their effective use. Variabilities arise from donor- and tissue-specific differences, such as age, sex, and tissue source. Moreover, adult-sourced MSCs have limited proliferation potentials, which hinders their long-term therapeutic efficacy. These limitations of adult MSCs have prompted researchers to develop a new method for generating MSCs. Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), such as embryonic stem cells and induced PSCs (iPSCs), can differentiate into various types of cells. Herein, a thorough review of the characteristics, functions, and clinical importance of MSCs is presented. The existing sources of MSCs, including adult- and infant-based sources, are compared. The most recent techniques for deriving MSCs from iPSCs, with a focus on biomaterial-assisted methods in both two- and three-dimensional culture systems, are listed and elaborated. Finally, several opportunities to develop improved methods for efficiently producing MSCs with the aim of advancing their various clinical applications are described. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Strategies to promote rapid formation of functional endothelium are required to maintain blood fluidity and regulate smooth muscle cell proliferation in synthetic vascular conduits. In this work, we explored the biofunctionalization of silk biomaterials with recombinantly expressed domain V of human perlecan (rDV) to promote endothelial cell interactions and the formation of functional endothelium. Perlecan is essential in vascular development and homeostasis and rDV has been shown to uniquely support endothelial cell, while inhibiting smooth muscle cell and platelet interactions, both key contributors of vascular graft failure. rDV was covalently immobilized on silk using plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII), a simple one-step surface treatment process which enables strong immobilization in the absence of chemical cross-linkers. rDV immobilization on surface-modified silk was assessed for amount, orientation, and bio-functionality in terms of endothelial cell interactions and functional endothelial layer formation. rDV immobilized on PIII-treated silk (rDV-PIII-silk) supported rapid endothelial cell adhesion, spreading, and proliferation to form functional endothelium, as evidenced by the expression of vinculin and VE-cadherin markers. Taken together, the results provide evidence for the potential of rDV-PIII-silk as a biomimetic vascular graft material. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Cartilage repair after a trauma or a degenerative disease like osteoarthritis (OA) continues to be a big challenge in current medicine due to the limited self-regenerative capacity of the articular cartilage tissues. To overcome the current limitations, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM) and adjacent areas have focused their efforts on new therapeutical procedures and materials capable of restoring normal tissue functionalities through polymeric scaffolding and stem cell engineering approaches. For this, the sustainable exploration of marine origin materials has emerged in the last years as a natural alternative to mammal sources, benefiting from their biological properties (e.g., biocompatibility, biodegradability, no toxicity, among others) for the development of several types of scaffolds. In this study, marine collagen(jCOL)-chitosan(sCHT)-fucoidan(aFUC)/chondroitin sulfate(aCS) were cryo-processed (−20 °C, −80 °C, and −196 °C) and a chemical-free crosslinking approach was explored to establish cohesive and stable cryogel materials. The cryogels were intensively characterized to assess their oscillatory behavior, thermal structural stability, thixotropic properties (around 45 % for the best formulations), injectability, and surface structural organization. Additionally, the cryogels demonstrate an interesting microenvironment in in vitro studies using human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs), supporting their viability and proliferation. In both physic-chemical and in vitro studies, the systems that contain fucoidan in their formulations, i.e., C1 (jCOL, sCHT, aFUC) and C3 (jCOL, sCHT, aFUC, aCS), submitted at −80 °C, are those that demonstrated most promising results for future application in articular cartilage tissues. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Tissue clearing of whole intact organs has enhanced imaging by enabling the exploration of tissue structure at a subcellular level in three-dimensional space. Although clearing and imaging of the whole organ have been used to study tissue biology, the microenvironment in which cells evolve to adapt to biomaterial implants or allografts in the body is poorly understood. Obtaining high-resolution information from complex cell–biomaterial interactions with volumetric landscapes represents a key challenge in the fields of biomaterials and regenerative medicine. To provide a new approach to examine how tissue responds to biomaterial implants, we apply cleared tissue light-sheet microscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction to utilize the wealth of autofluorescence information for visualizing and contrasting anatomical structures. This study demonstrates the adaptability of the clearing and imaging technique to provide sub-cellular resolution (0.6 μm isotropic) 3D maps of various tissue types, using samples from fully intact peritoneal organs to volumetric muscle loss injury specimens. Specifically, in the volumetric muscle loss injury model, we provide 3D visualization of the implanted extracellular matrix biomaterial in the wound bed of the quadricep muscle groups and further apply computational-driven image classification to analyze the autofluorescence spectrum at multiple emission wavelengths to categorize tissue types at the injured site interacting with the biomaterial scaffolds.

Nanocrystalline metals have provided new opportunities in producing high-strength biomaterials, but the biocompatibility of these nanometals needs to be improved. In this study, we introduce metal-protein nanocomposites as high-strength biomaterials with superior biocompatibility. Small proportions of bovine serum albumin (2 and 5 vol%), an abundant protein in the mammalian body, are added to titanium, and two nanocomposites are synthesized using a severe plastic deformation process of high-pressure torsion. These new biomaterials show not only a high hardness similar to nanocrystalline pure titanium but also exhibit better biocompatibility (including cellular metabolic activity, cell cycle parameters and DNA fragmentation profile) compared to nano-titanium. These results introduce a pathway to design new biocompatible composites by employing compounds from the human body. © 2023, The Author(s).},

After performing morphological and chemical characterizations, we validated the developed material functionalities in both in vitro and in vivo models. The chemical and morphological analysis with physical structure, swelling ratio, encapsulation efficiency, CEO release, and water barrier properties of films examined and showed the structural interaction of κ-Car and CEO-loaded into the polymer network. Furthermore, the bioactive applications of CEO release showed initial burst release followed by controlled release from the κ-Car composite film with fibroblast (L929) cell adhesive capabilities and mechanosensing. Our results proved that the CEO-loaded into the κ-Car film impacts cell adhesion, F-actin organization, and collagen synthesis, followed by in vitro mechanosensing activation, further promoting wound healing in vivo.

	abstract = {This opinion-led review paper highlights the need for novel translational research in vital-pulp-treatment (VPT), but also discusses the challenges in translating evidence to clinics. Traditional dentistry is expensive, invasive and relies on an outmoded mechanical understanding of dental disease, rather than employing a biological perspective that harnesses cell activity and the regenerative-capacity. Recent research has focussed on developing minimally-invasive biologically-based ‘fillings’ that preserve the dental pulp; research that is shifting the paradigm from expensive high-technology dentistry, with high failure rates, to smart restorations targeted at biological processes. Current VPTs promote repair by recruiting odontoblast-like cells in a material-dependent process. Therefore, exciting opportunities exist for development of next-generation biomaterials targeted at regenerative processes in the dentin-pulp complex. This article analyses recent research using pharmacological-inhibitors to therapeutically-target histone-deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes in dental-pulp-cells (DPCs) that stimulate pro-regenerative effects with limited loss of viability. Consequently, HDAC-inhibitors have the potential to enhance biomaterial-driven tissue responses at low concentration by influencing the cellular processes with minimal side-effects, providing an opportunity to develop a topically-placed, inexpensive bio-inductive pulp-capping material. Despite positive results, clinical translation of these innovations requires enterprise to counteract regulatory obstacles, dental-industry priorities and to develop strong academic/industry partnerships. The aim of this opinion-led review paper is to discuss the potential role of therapeutically-targeting epigenetic modifications as part of a topical VPT strategy in the treatment of the damaged dental pulp, while considering the next steps, material considerations, challenges and future for the clinical development of epigenetic therapeutics or other ‘smart’ restorations in VPT. © 2023 The Authors},

The synthesis parameters such as reagent concentrations, pH, reaction time, temperature, pressure, and stirring rate were optimized in order to produce calcium phosphates (CaPs) ceramics with restricted morphologies and composition. As a result, we obtained hydroxyapatite in the form of whiskers, hexagonal rods, nano particles, flowers, and cylinders. The products were characterized according to their structure (FTIR and XRD), morphology (SEM), and functional properties, i.e., the specific surface area. The obtained results indicate that the reagent concentration and pH values have the greatest impact on the HAp properties; however, the proper combination of all the mentioned parameters should be considered when there is a need for a bioceramic with defined physicochemical properties and an appropriate morphology. © 2023 by the authors.},

Successful 3D bioprinting requires bioinks with specific properties, such as biocompatibility, printability, and biodegradability according to the desired application. In the present work, we aimed at developing a new versatile blend of gelatin methacryloyl-xanthan gum (GelMA-XG) suitable for extrusion-based 3D bioprinting with a straightforward process. To this end, we first optimized the process of gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) synthesis by investigating the impact of different buffer solutions on the degree of functionalization, swelling degree, and degradation rate. The addition of xanthan gum (XG) enabled further tuning of biodegradability and an improvement of GelMA printability. Specifically, an optimal concentration of XG was found through rheological characterization and printability tests. The optimized blend showed enhanced printability and improved shape fidelity as well as its degradation products turned out to be non-cytotoxic, thus laying the foundation for cell-based applications. In conclusion, our newly developed biomaterial ink is a promising candidate for extrusion-based 3D bioprinting. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

Recent research has demonstrated that nano-biomaterials exhibit unique biochemphysical properties at the nanoscale, providing a prospective approach to overcoming these obstacles. In this review, the authors first survey the occurrence, processes, and detection methods of ICD. Subsequently, the recent advances of nano-biomaterials applied to enhance ICD according to the key steps in the process of ICD, particularly with a focus on the mechanisms and lifting schemes are investigated.

	abstract = {Bio-integrated optoelectronics can be interfaced with biological tissues, thereby offering opportunities for clinical diagnosis and therapy. However, finding a suitable biomaterial-based semiconductor to interface with electronics is still challenging. In this study, a semiconducting layer is assembled comprising a silk protein hydrogel and melanin nanoparticles (NPs). The silk protein hydrogel provides a water-rich environment for the melanin NPs that maximizes their ionic conductivity and bio-friendliness. An efficient photodetector is produced by forming a junction between melanin NP-silk and a p-type Si (p-Si) semiconductor. The observed charge accumulation/transport behavior at the melanin NP-silk/p-Si junction is associated with the ionic conductive state of the melanin NP-silk composite. The melanin NP-silk semiconducting layer is printed as an array on an Si substrate. The photodetector array exhibits uniform photo-response to illumination at various wavelengths, thus providing broadband photodetection. Efficient charge transfer between melanin NP-silk and Si provides fast photo-switching with rise and decay constants of 0.44 ​s and 0.19 ​s, respectively. The photodetector with a biotic interface comprising an Ag nanowire-incorporated silk layer as the top contact can operate when underneath biological tissue. The photo-responsive biomaterial-Si semiconductor junction using light as a stimulus offers a bio-friendly and versatile platform for artificial electronic skin/tissue. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Marine collagen, as a biomedical material, has been taken into consideration because of low immunogenicity, biodegradibility, as well as being water soluble, safe, and easily-extractable. We extracted acid-soluble collagen (ASC) from Scomberomorus commerson fish skin found in Persian Gulf, Iran and conducted chemical and physical characterizations using various techniques including thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction, Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR), sodium dodecyl sulphate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and MTT assay of the ASC. Our results showed that the yield of ASC was 20.30%. SEM observation demonstrated that the structure of the extracted collagen was fibrils with irregular dense sheet-like structures. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that S.commerson ASC had α (α1and α2) and β chains, presumably belonging to type I collagen. The amount of amino acids and proline in ASC was 18 per 1,000 residues and 90.7 per 706.1 residues, respectively. Also, 27.06% of the collagen was composed of glycine. FTIR analysis and the spectrum X-ray diffraction demonstrated that the S.commerson skin collagen had a triple-helix structure with the ASC denaturation temperatures of 45 °C and 291.89 ºC. Cell activity and proliferation testing demonstrated that S. commerson collagen sample promote cell growth and proliferation and its hydrophilicity leads to cell attachment. In conclusion, the S. commerson fish skin can perform as an affordable collagen source for medical biomaterials and pharmaceutical applications. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {In view of the complicated operation and time-consuming of traditional detection methods for biomaterial activity, a method based on the mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy coupled with chemometrics methods was proposed to achieve the non-destructive and rapid determination of the biomaterial activity. The spectral preprocessing methods were applied to reduce the noise and scattering effects in the spectral analysis, which can effectively improve the performance of biomaterial activity determination model. The characteristic wavelengths of the preprocessed spectrum were extracted by the successive projections algorithm (SPA). And the determination performance of different regression algorithms for biomaterial activity was compared and discussed. Results demonstrated that the model of SPA combined with partial least squares regression (PLSR), which exhibited better potential for the determination of biomaterial activity with higher coefficient of determination (R2) and lower root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP). The R2 acquired by the optimal model for three biomaterials are 0.9622, 0.9949, and 0.9936, respectively. And the RMSEP were 0.0611, 0.0186, and 0.0193, respectively. Therefore, the SPA-PLSR established by MIR is expected to replace the traditional methods for quantitative determination of biomaterial activity. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {The possibility of using protein-based materials as cellular scaffold strongly depends on protein conformation, and several attempts have been made by researchers to obtain scaffold with morphology miming the extracellular matrix. It is widely recognized that the secondary structure of proteins affects the mechanical and biological properties of protein-based scaffolds. However, few studies have been published, and an exhaustive explanation is still missing. In this work the study of the gelatin structure in gelatin-based materials and the investigation of the possible correlations between structure, mechanical and biological features is reported. We have examined how the secondary structure of gelatin is affected (i) by the process used to obtain the biomaterials (solvent casting vs. electrospinning), (ii) by the concentration of cross linker (3-(Glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane) (GPTMS), and (iii) by the raw keratin extract added. Gelatin electrospun materials have shown a content of ordered structure higher than gelatin casted films, likely due to the random coil – α-helix transition occuring during electrospinning. GPTMS gives a decrease of ordered structures in gelatin casted films (random structure increasing from 20% to 60%), while it does not affect the percentage of ordered structure in electrospun samples. In the gelatin/keratin electrospun biomaterials, the presence of keratin produces a decrease of α-helix content from 31% to 2–15% and an increase of β-structures, promoting the conversion from antiparallel to parallel β-sheet. The structure of gelatin affects the mechanical performances of biomaterials. In gelatin/keratin electrospun biomaterials we have found a positive correlation between failure strain and helix conformation and a negative correlation with β-structures. Elastic modulus has opposite correlations. All gelatin-based biomaterials have been tested as scaffold for pre-osteoblastic cells showing good biocompatibility for both casted films and electrospun biomaterials. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Autologous nerve transplantation is the gold standard for treating peripheral nerve defects, but it is associated with defects such as insufficient donor and secondary injury. Artificial nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) are now considered promising alternatives for bridging long nerve gaps, although exploring new biomaterials to construct NGCs remains challenging. Silk fibroin (SF) has good biocompatibility and can self-assemble in aqueous solutions. However, the lack of proximal neurotrophic factors after nerve injury is a major concern, leading to incomplete nerve regeneration. In this study, NT-3, a neurotrophin that promotes neuronal survival and differentiation, was bound to the light chain of silk fibroin (FIBL) in two ways: one was directly bound to FIBL (FIBL-NT3) and the other was a polypeptides-linker (FIBL-Linker-NT3). The design aimed to take advantage of silk fiber's character of self-assembly of heavy-light chains and test whether a flexible linker with NT3 molecule is easy to be a NT3 dimer, the active form. In vitro studies indicated that FIBL-Linker-NT3 combined with SF membranes promoted axon growth in adult rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Then we tested if FIBL-Linker-NT3 could self-assemble with the SF heavy chain (SFH). DTT (Dithiothreitol) was used to break the disulfide bonds between the SF light and heavy chains, and the light-chain protein was removed via dialysis. SFH was assembled using FIBL-Linker-NT3, as evidenced by the western blotting results that showed a high molecular band corresponding to SFH-FIBL-Linker-NT3. Chitosan scaffolds have been identified to provide a suitable microenvironment, so a chitosan/SF-FIBL-Linker-NT3 conduit was also constructed. Nerve transplantation of this conduit was evaluated in vivo in a rat sciatic nerve defect model. Immunohistochemical assays showed that the chitosan/SF-FIBL-Linker-NT3 group was superior to the chitosan/PBS, SF, PBS + FIBL-Linker-NT3 groups in nerve regeneration. In addition, the chitosan/SF-FIBL-Linker-NT3 conduit-transplanted group exhibited better recovery in terms of neurite length, sciatic functional index value, sensitivity to heat, time on the rotarod, wet weight ratio, cross-sectional area, compound muscle action potential, number of myelin layers, and myelin thickness in the nerve. Taking together, our study identified that FIBL-Linker-NT3 could promote axonal growth and regeneration in vivo and in vitro and is a promising candidate biomaterial for artificial NGCs. © 2023},

	abstract = {Zeolites are aluminosilicate compounds with excellent selective, precise adsorption capabilities that find their potential applications in various sectors of the biomaterials and food industry. The zeolites from ages have been utilized in biomedicine, catalysis, detergent and air purification industries but their commercial applications in the biomaterials and food industry are not studied enough. Zeolites are known to reduce mycotoxins, toxic compounds, heavy metals, and microbes. The present review tries to summarize different arenas of zeolite applications in the biomaterials and food industry. The article also includes a discussion of individual applications of zeolitic properties like antimicrobial effect, food nanoreactors and intelligent food contact behaviour in brief. Moreover, sound coverage is given over zeolite classification, their synthesis and the modelling of their adsorption behaviour. The outcomes of the review emphasize the commercial viability of zeolites and their potential to serve as a possible alternative to many processing steps which ultimately will economise the production process in the food industry. This review also emphasizes extensive research that needs to be carried out to further improvise the capabilities of zeolites to overcome the challenges lying around them. © 2023},

	abstract = {Postoperative adhesions are one of the clinically significant complications of almost all surgeries, leading to lifelong problems. To date, three strategies have been introduced to prevent or reduce the formation of these fibrous bands, including implementation of physical barriers, local or systemic administration of pharmacological agents, or a combination of both at the site of postsurgical traumatized tissue. This so far unsolved challenge has prompted scientists to focus on developing more effective preventative therapies. In this review, we aimed to provide a detailed overview of drug-free and drug-incorporated anti-adhesion barrier membranes and micro/nano-drug delivery systems implemented for postoperative adhesion prevention. The formulation components, the mean particle sizes of the particulate-based systems, release behavior of pharmacologic agents, and various evaluation methods determining the in vivo efficacy of the prepared systems in animal models including scoring, gross evaluation, Western blot, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), tissue scanning electron microscopy (SEM), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), histological and immunohistochemical analyses were identified and discussed. Although a great number of studies have focused on the preparation and evaluation of the anti-adhesion efficacy of drug-free or drug-loaded anti-adhesion systems, further sophisticated research is required to develop effective and safe anti-adhesion products for clinical application. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Green nanotechnology plays a significant role in many domains, from medicine to agriculture. Antibiotic resistance has emerged in organisms because of the continuous and indiscriminate application of various antibiotics. MDR (Multi drug resistant) bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Staphylococcus aureus were found to be resistant to beta- lactam antibiotics. In this study, the aqueous extract of Colletotrichum siamense was used to engineer nanoparticles (CsNps) and tea tree oil-based nanoemulsion (CsNe). Engineered CsNps and CsNe were subjected to biophysical characterization by using UV visible spectroscopy, FESEM, EDAX, FT-IR, HRTEM, SAED, and zeta potential to determine the charge, size, stability, elemental composition, topography, etc., The CsNps and CsNe were screened to detect antimicrobial activity by the zone of inhibition, MIC, MBC, and biofilm inhibition to its test potential against pathogenic E. coli, K. pnuemoniae, A. baumannii, and S. aureus. In silico studies were performed to study the binding affinity of the virulence proteins of MDR pathogens with secondary metabolites of Colletotrichum siamense. The results of both in vitro and in-silico studies of nanoparticles and nano-emulsion were observed to be more promising than beta-lactam antibiotics. Hence, in near future, these endophytic fungi, C. siamense mediated nanoparticles (CsNps) and nanoemulsion (CsNe) can be employed to develop an alternative to beta lactam antibiotics against the MDR pathogens. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Alginate and gelatin are bio-polymers widely used in drug delivery. A range of salts can be used to achieve the required flexibility in biomaterial design. Hofmeister series gives an idea about the behaviour of salts with proteins. However, its application for the design of biomaterials and their specific effect on high-viscosity polymers and polymer mixtures has not quite been explored. Firstly, this work proposes a strategic interaction-based approach for designing a dual-drug ocular biomaterial. Secondly, the impact of different salt anions on gelatin and alginate mixture for the developed protocols is studied by a proposed method of determining shear-dependent general intrinsic viscosity. Thirdly, shear-dependent intrinsic viscosity is used to determine the interaction amongst the polymers in their mixture, which is then correlated to the release profiles and hydrodynamic radii of polymer mixtures. It is observed that Hofmeister anions behave reversely for high-viscosity negatively charged polymers and depends on the charge densities of the anions. For the polyelectrolyte/polyampholyte complex/mixture, the interactions depend on the addition sequence. It is inferred that the kosmotropes are preferred for protocols where salt is added between gelatin and alginate and chaotropes for protocols where salt is added to the gelatin and alginate complex/mixture in terms of release profiles. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Macrophages can be polarized into the M1 and M2 types under the stimulation of different factors. They have proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects, respectively, and play key roles in different stages of bone regeneration. The ratio of M1 to M2 macrophages can be regulated by immunomodulatory biomaterials to promote bone repair and regeneration. In this paper, we review the recent literature on the chemical, physical and biological properties of biomaterials and the regulation of macrophage polarization under the influence of other factors.

	abstract = {Among key factors determining the fate of biomaterials in vivo are their interactions with blood serum proteins, which can lead to either successful integration or rejection/encapsulation. Although there are a number of studies investigating the interactions between proteins and bioimplants, comparable data for different types of biomaterials are lacking. To fill this gap, the adsorption kinetics and binding interactions of bovine serum albumin (BSA) with calcium phosphates (CaPs), namely hydroxyapatite (HA) and calcium deficient apatite (CaDHA), different TiO2 nanomaterials (TiNMs) presenting various morphologies such as nanoparticles (TiNPs), nanoplatelets (TiNPls), nanotubes (TiNTs) and nanowires (TiNWs), as well as their composites with CaDHA (CaDHA/TiNMs) were investigated. The kinetics of BSA adsorption on all studied materials was best described by pseudo-second order kinetics. The rate coefficient values obtained for the composites were lower than those for CaDHA and the corresponding TiNMs, while the adsorption density was higher for the composites than for CaDHA, except for the composites with TiNTs. Adsorption on TiNWs, CaDHA and all composites involved intraparticle diffusion, which was the rate-limiting step only for CaDHA/TiNTs. Fluorimetric titration experiments revealed that the number of binding sites was in larger than 1, except for TiNTs and TiNWs, indicating positive binding cooperativity. Interestingly, the values of the binding constants were lower for the TiNMs with a higher adsorption rate coefficient. Overall, BSA adsorption on the studied materials proved to be a complex process, which depended on the different surface properties of the adsorbents. Which property had a dominant role depended on the chemical identity of the adsorbent. The obtained comparable data for different types of materials point to the way of modifying their protein adsorption and binding properties. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Chitin is a naturally occurring biopolymer, while chitosan is a deacetylated derivative of chitin. The unique properties of chitin/chitosan, such as nitrogen-rich, biodegradability, non-toxicity, high adsorption capacity, and biocompatibility, allow them to be utilized as precursors for CO2 adsorbents in pursuing the circular economy. This review provides a detailed overview of chitosan-based biomaterials as adsorbents for CO2 capture, focusing on extraction techniques, specialized treatments, adsorbent synthesis methodologies, and the CO2 capture performance of the resultant adsorbents. In general, current extraction techniques are still dominated by chemical and biological means, but more efficient and environmental-friendly techniques are emerging and developing towards maturity. The structural characteristics of modified/functionalized chitosan-based adsorbents and the effect of adsorption process parameters on CO2 uptake are reviewed to highlight their potential in CO2 capture. Besides the conventional treatments of carbonization and chemical activation, incorporating oxide nanoparticles, clay, metal-organic framework, and zeolites to form hybrid chitosan-based CO2 adsorbents showed promising performance in CO2 capture. The morphology, structural, and surface chemistry characteristics were reported to show enhancement after treatments. Based on literature screening, the highest CO2 adsorption capacity reported was ∼8 mmol/g adsorbent with 1 nm micropores and 2 nm mesopores favorable for CO2 adsorption at atmospheric pressure and elevated pressure, respectively. Furthermore, the technological gaps and limitations of each extraction and synthesis technique, overall challenges, and outlook are elucidated. The hybridization of adsorbent synthesis and modification methods could be the main way to enhance the adsorbent performance, economic viability, and environmental sustainability in the commercial-scale context. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Magnesium alloys have been known as the revolutionary metallic materials because of their excellent biocompatibility and degradability. The effect of its degradation on endothelialization has great research significance. OBJECTIVE: To review the research progress of magnesium alloy materials. METHODS: The articles were searched by using the databases of PubMed, CNKI, Web of Science, and Elsevier. The key words were “Metallic biomaterials, Mag-nesium alloys, Vascular stents, Endothelialization, Animal experiments, In vitro” in Chinese and English. As a result, 116 articles were applied after reading and analyzing the titles and abstracts of the articles published between 2015 and 2022. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Appropriate concentrations of magnesium ions can enhance the proliferation of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells during the degradation of magnesium alloys. The effect of magnesium ions on endothelialization is basically recognized. Nevertheless, too fast degradation rate is the biggest problem of magnesium alloys. If the concentration of magnesium ions is too high, cytotoxicity will occur. Therefore, current studies mostly focus on improving its degradation and improving its biocompatibility. At present, the common methods to improve the degradation of magnesium alloys include purification, alloying and surface modification, all of which can improve their corrosion resistance. The alloying of different elements can improve magnesium alloys in different ways. In the future, different alloyed magnesium alloys can be used according to different needs to adapt to the situation of clinical patients. In addition to introducing other elements, improving the production process of magnesium alloys to solve the degradation problem may also be a method worth trying. © 2023, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

Food wastes have emerged as a global problem contributing to the release of greenhouse gases. These wastes can serve as potential bioresources for value-added products like biomaterials which can be used for the remediation of environmental pollutants. However, sustainable technology is needed for transforming the food wastes into biomaterials; which will also solve their disposal issues. This review explores potential food wastes for producing biomaterials, their extraction methods, and application in removing pollutants. Challenges encountered in handling, processing, and large scale production of biomaterials from food wastes and strategy to overcome them has also been discussed. This review will provide a complete guidance for selecting appropriate food waste and the methods of developing biomaterials that can effectively remove the target contaminants in future. © 2023},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study reviews explicitly wastes that are frequently overlooked in Indonesia, namely waste from fish in scales and bones, scaffold derived from natural hydroxyapatite, and efforts to improve the synthesis of hydroxyapatite produced from fish waste. This study uses a narrative review by emphasizing fishbone waste as biomaterials in the health aspect. The databases used to find references were primarily focused on Science Direct, which contained 14 research articles included in the review (2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021). It is believed that the composition of fish scales is similar to human hard tissue, and the composition of fishbone is similar to natural human bone. In fish scales and bones, both contain a significant amount of hydroxyapatite, which can be used as a biomaterial, particularly a bone scaffold. Hydroxyapatite derived from scale and fishbone has good biocompatibility and is nontoxic. However, some researchers discovered that scaffolds made from fish scales and bones are fragile and need to be strengthened by adding other materials such as chitosan or other polymers to make them more durable.  © 2023 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Porous biomaterials design for bone repair is still largely limited to regular structures (e.g. rod-based lattices), due to their easy parameterization and high controllability. The capability of designing stochastic structure can redefine the boundary of our explorable structure–property space for synthesizing next-generation biomaterials. We hereby propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach for efficient generation and design of spinodal structure—an intriguing structure with stochastic yet interconnected, smooth, and constant pore channel conducive to bio-transport. Our CNN-based approach simultaneously possesses the tremendous flexibility of physics-based model in generating various spinodal structures (e.g. periodic, anisotropic, gradient, and arbitrarily large ones) and comparable computational efficiency to mathematical approximation model. We thus successfully design spinodal bone structures with target anisotropic elasticity via high-throughput screening, and directly generate large spinodal orthopedic implants with desired gradient porosity. This work significantly advances stochastic biomaterials development by offering an optimal solution to spinodal structure generation and design. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydroxyl radicals ([rad]OH) and singlet oxygen (1O2) have emerged as promising therapeutic agents for combating biofilm-associated bacterial infections. However, the hypoxic microenvironments in the biofilms severely hinder the ROS production. Herein, we have rationally integrated copper peroxide (CP) and indocyanine green (ICG) into a polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticle to construct a versatile hybrid nanoplatform (PDA/CP/ICG), which can enhance ROS generation for highly efficient biofilm elimination by relieving hypoxic microenvironment. When the PDA/CP/ICG accumulates at the infection site or biofilm, the acidic microenvironment triggers the co-release of Cu2+ and H2O2, and the former can catalyze the conversion of self-supplied H2O2 into [rad]OH via a Fenton-like reaction and consume the overexpressed antioxidant glutathione (GSH) to further promote the oxidative stress. Moreover, with the help of an 808 nm laser, the hyperpyrexia caused by PDA induces the decomposition of CP into O2 that is immediately converted by ICG into 1O2. The PDA/CP/ICG shows satisfactory antibacterial and antibiofilm effect due to the self-amplified production of [rad]OH and 1O2, and outstanding wound healing with good in vivo biosafety. Overall, this study provides a facile paradigm in ROS-based biofilm elimination, and the proposed hypoxia-irrelevant bactericidal nanoplatform has great potential for future biomedical applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Aging is characterized by progressive decline in tissue function and represents the greatest risk factor for many diseases. Nevertheless, many fundamental mechanisms driving human aging remain poorly understood. Aging studies using model organisms are often limited in their applicability to humans. Mechanistic studies of human aging rely on relatively simple cell culture models that fail to replicate mature tissue function, making them poor surrogates for aged tissues. These culture systems generally lack well-controlled cellular microenvironments that capture the changes in tissue mechanics and microstructure that occur during aging. Biomaterial platforms presenting dynamic, physiologically relevant mechanical, structural, and biochemical cues can capture the complex changes in the cellular microenvironment in a well-defined manner, accelerating the process of cellular aging in model laboratory systems. By enabling selective tuning of relevant microenvironmental parameters, these biomaterials systems may enable identification of new therapeutic approaches to slow or reverse the detrimental effects of aging. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Chitosan (CS) is a natural biopolymer that shows promise as a biomaterial for bone-tissue regeneration. However, because of their limited ability to induce cell differentiation and high degradation rate, among other drawbacks associated with its use, the creation of CS-based biomaterials remains a problem in bone tissue engineering research. Here we aimed to reduce these disadvantages while retaining the benefits of potential CS biomaterial by combining it with silica to provide sufficient additional structural support for bone regeneration. In this work, CS-silica xerogel and aerogel hybrids with 8 wt.% CS content, designated SCS8X and SCS8A, respectively, were prepared by sol-gel method, either by direct solvent evaporation at the atmospheric pressure or by supercritical drying in CO2, respectively. As reported in previous studies, it was confirmed that both types of mesoporous materials exhibited large surface areas (821 m2g−1–858 m2g−1) and outstanding bioactivity, as well as osteoconductive properties. In addition to silica and chitosan, the inclusion of 10 wt.% of tricalcium phosphate (TCP), designated SCS8T10X, was also considered, which stimulates a fast bioactive response of the xerogel surface. The results here obtained also demonstrate that xerogels induced earlier cell differentiation than the aerogels with identical composition. In conclusion, our study shows that the sol-gel synthesis of CS-silica xerogels and aerogels enhances not only their bioactive response, but also osteoconduction and cell differentiation properties. Therefore, these new biomaterials should provide adequate secretion of the osteoid for a fast bone regeneration. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Biopolymers are promising environmentally benign materials applicable in multifarious applications. They are especially favorable in implantable biomedical devices thanks to their excellent unique properties, including bioactivity, renewability, bioresorbability, biocompatibility, biodegradability and hydrophilicity. Additive manufacturing (AM) is a flexible and intricate manufacturing technology, which is widely used to fabricate biopolymer-based customized products and structures for advanced healthcare systems. Three-dimensional (3D) printing of these sustainable materials is applied in functional clinical settings including wound dressing, drug delivery systems, medical implants and tissue engineering. The present review highlights recent advancements in different types of biopolymers, such as proteins and polysaccharides, which are employed to develop different biomedical products by using extrusion, vat polymerization, laser and inkjet 3D printing techniques in addition to normal bioprinting and four-dimensional (4D) bioprinting techniques. This review also incorporates the influence of nanoparticles on the biological and mechanical performances of 3D-printed tissue scaffolds. This work also addresses current challenges as well as future developments of environmentally friendly polymeric materials manufactured through the AM techniques. Ideally, there is a need for more focused research on the adequate blending of these biodegradable biopolymers for achieving useful results in targeted biomedical areas. We envision that biopolymer-based 3D-printed composites have the potential to revolutionize the biomedical sector in the near future. © 2023},

	abstract = {We aimed to determine the coacervation properties of high-molecular-weight (HMW) tissue-derived elastin (TDE) and to examine the potential use of TDE particles as a cosmetic biomaterial. TDE solutions were filtered and divided into three fractions (1–3) according to the molecular weight of the elastin. The turbidity of fraction 2, which contained a large portion (58%) of HMW elastin polypeptides (>100 kDa), was measured under several pH values (3.0–11.0) and NaCl concentrations (0–1000 mM) to examine its coacervation ability. HMW TDE exhibited coacervation under the physiological conditions (temperature, pH, and NaCl concentration) of the skin surface. We performed inclusion and release experiments using three model chemicals with different molecular weights and measured the size and zeta potential of the fraction 3 particles to investigate the suitability of HMW elastin polypeptides. Fraction 3, which contained a larger portion (64%) of HMW elastin polypeptides, displayed a strong coacervation property at a phase transition temperature of 19.8 ± 0.1°C. The inclusion ratio of the model chemical Biebrich Scarlet (BS) with a molecular weight of <600 was approximately 92.1 ± 0.7%. The release profiles of BS from the particles linearly increased and reached a plateau after 15 days. Moreover, the average size of the particles with BS was 474.2 ± 24.6 nm. The low-molecular-weight (LMW) elastin peptides have moisturizing and whitening functions for the skin. We concluded that TDE, as a mixture of HMW polypeptides and LMW peptides, can potentially serve as a multifunctional and effective cosmetic biomaterial. © 2022 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Flocculants are one of the most essential tools in the hand of an environmental engineer or mineral processing technologist. However, most of the flocculants available in the market are polyacrylamide based. This always poses the threat of acrylamide release during the degradation process and also the chances of occluded acrylamide during synthesis. Acrylamide is a powerful neurotoxin and a teratogen. Our work endeavors to develop next-generation safer flocculants that are acrylamide free and hence are safer alternatives. Guar gum, an industrial crop native to the Indian subcontinent was grafted with monomer Diallyl Dimethyl Ammonium chloride (DADMAC) by microwave-assisted technique. This novel grafted product was characterized via standard physico-chemical techniques. The flocculation efficacy of the grafted biomaterial was studied through standard jar test and settling test procedures in standard kaolin and coal fine suspensions. Once superior flocculation properties of the grafted product were ascertained, it was studied as a flocculant for the destabilization of Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) from its suspension. This study endeavors the synthesis of a value-added product of guar gum with established efficacy towards nanoparticle destabilization properties. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Cathodic electrical stimulation has previously been studied for both the augmentation of bone healing as well as the treatment of implant associated infections. One of the proposed mechanisms of both of these effects is the electrochemical generation of hydrogen peroxide during the oxygen reduction reaction.

The oxygen reduction reaction has been shown to be complex on passivated metal electrodes such as these. Therefore, the exact potential ranges of H2O2 generation on these materials in physiologically relevant media are not fully characterized.

	abstract = {Background: Several blood replacements have been developed because of issues with blood collection and storage, increased expenditures, and a global lack of reserves. Studies on artificial blood primarily concentrate on the research and synthesis of molecules that transport oxygen. The primary objective of the current work was to create a supporting, oxygen-carrying biological material that can replace blood and be used to save lives when blood is not available. Methods: The work started with the synthesis of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONS), and two distinct procedures were applied to ensure binding to hemoglobin (Hb) molecules. The surface modifications of the particles were carried out gradually by 3-amino propyl trimethoxy silane (3APGASPIONS) and tartaric acid (TASPIONS). Analysis methods used to characterize the particles include Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FT-IR), elemental analysis (EDX), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), and high contrast transmission electron microscopy (C-TEM). The characterization studies of SPIONS which bind Hb molecules to the surface were repeated and their effects on endothelial cell culture were examined to determine their toxic effects in vitro. Cell proliferation, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity changes were assessed in the evaluation of the possible toxic effects of the cells against the treated particles in the prepared cell lines. Blood substitute solutions synthesized by two different methods were stored on the shelf for about 1 month and the results were compared with fresh Hb solutions. Results and Conclusion: The CV and UV analysis results obtained from artificial Hb substitutes revealed that the structural integrity of Hb molecules did not change, the oxygen transport capabilities of biomolecules were preserved, and this state remained stable for a long time. Furthermore, it was determined that nanocomplexes synthesized by the two methods caused different cellular proliferation and there was a more limited increase in cellular enzyme activities (SOD, CAT, GPx) of Hb-bound particle solutions when compared to pure SPIONS. © 2023 The Author(s)},

This investigation aims to evaluate the effect of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) on endometrial regeneration. In this study, a double-dose non-activated PRP therapy was administered by repeatedly infusing a similar volume of non-activated PRP 24 h after the first dose in the in vitro damaged endometrial tissue models and in vivo injured uterine models. Histology, implantation, and pregnancy assessments of endometrial structure and function were performed. We discovered that in the in vitro models, the treated endometrial tissues appeared to have endometrial epithelium, uterine glands, pinopodes, and embryos that were able to implant on the endometrium. The rate of implanted embryos in the treated models was 18.89% ± 0.02 higher than those in the non-treated group with no embryo implantation (P-value <0.05). Animal models also showed similar results. The uterine structure was restored, the number of glands (143.3 ± 9.815) and the thickness (rate of endometrial area (EA)/total horn area (THA) was 0.4013 ± 0.0344) were increased in the treated models (P-value <0.05). The number of pregnancies (implantation sites) in the treated mouse models was 10.33 ± 1.53.

	abstract = {In the present study, an inexpensive bioadsorbent was developed using fish scales treated by a novel alkaline heat treatment process to extract hydroxyapatite. The synthesized glutaraldehyde crosslinked Chitosan@Hydroxyapatite biocomposite was characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and SEM-EDS analyses and applied as tunable biosorbent for Orange G dye. To evaluate the efficiency of adsorption, the influence of the initial pH, contact time, and initial dye concentration on the process was investigated. The highest adsorption capacity was 217.466 mg g−1, and the adsorption experimental results for OG dye molecules matched well with the pseudo-second-order and Langmuir isotherm models. Concerning the thermodynamic parameters, the ∆G and ∆H values confirm the spontaneous and exothermic character of the adsorption process. Additionally, FT-IR spectroscopy revealed that the OG adsorption occurs through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction between the free hydroxyl and amino groups present on the biocomposite surface and the sulfonate groups in the OG molecules. Response surface methodology based on Box–Behnken design (RSM-BBD) was applied to optimize the effects of the main input factors to remove OG dye. An optimum OG dye removal efficiency of 92% was obtained at 12.5 mg adsorbent dose, 50 mg L−1 dye concentration, and 120 min contact time. CT-GA@HAp hybrid was successfully regenerated up to the fifth cycle, indicating that it can be used as a promising, feasible and environmentally friendly biosorbent composite. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {There are several disposal and governance difficulties due to rapid bio-waste growth. Therefore, recycling and repurposing them for environmental purposes is garnering increasing attention. Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) followed by phosphoric acid activation was used in this investigation to synthesize a novel activated hydrochar (AHPP) from pomegranate peels. X-Ray Diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) surface area analysis and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution, and pH of zero charge were exploited to define the characteristics of AHPP, which was then used to assess the uptake of Basic Red 46 (BR46) dye in the batch mode. Isothermal and kinetic investigations were accomplished with pH = 6, 0.5 g.L−1 of adsorbent, 400 rpm at 298 K upon 60 min. The Freundlich model accurately presented the equilibrium curves with an adsorption capacity of 998.95 mg g−1, while the PSO kinetic model adequately corresponded to the experimental data. Furthermore, thermodynamic data disclosed that the process was spontaneous, endothermic, and linked to a growing disorder at the adsorbent-adsorbate interface. Lastly, the reuse investigation using HCl ascertained that AHPP might be recycled ten times, whereas a probable adsorption mechanism was proffered.

	abstract = {The limitation of short-term usage of neural interfacing devices encouraged the development of neuro-specific biomaterials. Our hypothesis is that a biomaterial covered with the neuronal cell-derived membrane possessing neural cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) can promote neuronal adhesion and activation and minimize immune responses at the condition of neural implantation. To demonstrate the hypothesis, we prepared the titanium surface-modified with a PC12 cell membrane-derived lipid bilayer, covalently tethered on the surface (PM-TLB). Anti-fouling studies informed us that PM-TLB was sufficiently resistant to the fouling of plasma proteins as well as the adhesion of blood components and bacteria. Cell studies demonstrated that PM-TLB is specific to neuronal cells and non-specific to astrocytes and macrophages, clearly shown in a normal condition and an inflammatory condition. The neuronal activation study supported that PM-TLB improves the outgrowth of neurites and activation stages more than the poly(L-lysine) polymer, which is the most used substrate for neuronal cells. These results conclude that PM-TLB is an efficient surface modification showing selective modulation against neurons and the immune system, promoting neuronal interaction and suppressing neuro-inflammatory responses for applications to neuro-implantable devices. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Development of regenerative medicine requires multifunctional and bioactive materials/devices. Herein, we exploit a thermosensitive bioactive nanocomposite hydrogel composed of non-thermogelable poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone)-b-poly(D,L-alanine) (PVP-PA) and laponite nanoclay, which displays a sol–gel transition with warming. The incorporation of PVP-PA and laponite in water first triggers self-assembly driven by hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions to form nanocomposite assemblies, and then turns into a physical hydrogel upon heating due to the assembly aggregation plus the partial conformation transformation of PA and PVP segments. Meanwhile, the gelation behavior of the composite system can be easily modulated by simply changing the concentration of either component. The presence of bioactive laponite and the improvement of mechanical and physiological stability enable the nanocomposite hydrogel to remain intact in vivo for over 90 days and exhibit good biological activity, which not only facilitates cell infiltration and vascularization inside the gel but also achieves rapid hemostasis within 10 s in rat bleeding models. Finally, thanks to the efficient complexation between PVP and poorly water-soluble iodine, an injectable iodophor hydrogel is conveniently obtained. The long-lasting antibacterial activity induced by continuously released iodine makes the multifunctional bioactive nanocomposite system promising for rapid wound hemostasis and accelerated wound/tissue repair while preventing infection. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma is a common clinical disease. In recent years, the application of inorganic nonmetal biomaterials in the treatment of osteosarcoma has become a new way to overcome the bottleneck of traditional treatment. OBJECTIVE: To introduce the application of inorganic nonmetal biomaterials in the diagnosis and treatment of osteosarcoma, and to summarize its current research status and future application prospects. METHODS: A computer-based online search of Web of Science, PubMed, and CNKI was performed to retrieve articles regarding inorganic nonmetal biomaterials in the diagnosis and treatment of osteosarcoma and mainly retrieve experimental articles on the preparation, application and animal cell experiments of inorganic non-metallic biomaterials for osteosarcoma. Finally, 69 articles were included for review. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) Inorganic nonmetal biomaterials have excellent characteristics of good biocompatibility, stable physical and chemical properties, biodegradability and promoting osteogenesis. (2) The inherent shortcomings of inorganic nonmetallic materials, such as weak anti-fracture performance, high preparation process requirements, low loading dose of drugs and bioactive molecules, limit the application in the cases of bone defects in load-bearing areas and controlling drugs releasing. (3) At present, inorganic nonmetal biomaterials such as nano drug loading platform, biological implantation scaffold and material surface coating are wildly used in the treatment of osteosarcoma, which realizing new diagnosis and treatment strategies in chemokinetic therapy, nano targeted diagnosis and treatment, catalytic therapy, immunotherapy and tumor hyperthermia through functional modification. However, these researches mostly stay in the basic experimental stage for lacking of the clinical trial data support. (4) Improving the preparation process of inorganic nonmetallic materials, exploring new functional modification strategies and further extensive clinical evaluation are the key to turn the basic research into clinical practice and promote the sustainable development of inorganic nonmetallic materials. © 2023, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

	abstract = {Postoperative adhesion (POA) widely occurs in soft tissues and usually leads to chronic pain, dysfunction of adjacent organs and some acute complications, seriously reducing patients’ quality of life and even being life-threatening. Except for adhesiolysis, there are few effective methods to release existing adhesion. However, it requires a second operation and inpatient care and usually triggers recurrent adhesion in a great incidence. Hence, preventing POA formation has been regarded as the most effective clinical strategy. Biomaterials have attracted great attention in preventing POA because they can act as both barriers and drug carriers. Nevertheless, even though much reported research has been demonstrated their efficacy on POA inhibition to a certain extent, thoroughly preventing POA formation is still challenging. Meanwhile, most biomaterials for POA prevention were designed based on limited experiences, not a solid theoretical basis, showing blindness. Hence, we aimed to provide guidance for designing anti-adhesion materials applied in different soft tissues based on the mechanisms of POA occurrence and development. We first classified the postoperative adhesions into four categories according to the different components of diverse adhesion tissues, and named them as “membranous adhesion”, “vascular adhesion”, “adhesive adhesion” and “scarred adhesion”, respectively. Then, the process of the occurrence and development of POA were analyzed, and the main influencing factors in different stages were clarified. Further, we proposed seven strategies for POA prevention by using biomaterials according to these influencing factors. Meanwhile, the relevant practices were summarized according to the corresponding strategies and the future perspectives were analyzed. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Metals from spinal implants are released into surrounding tissues by various mechanisms. Metal ion release has been associated with clinical implant failure, osteolysis, and remote site accumulation with adverse events. Significant corrosion and associated metal ion release has been described with currently used spinal implant alloys. A novel metal alloy, Molybdenum-47.5Rhenium alloy (MoRe®), was approved for use in medical implants in 2019 by the FDA. PURPOSE: To evaluate the metal ion release profile of MoRe alloy after immersion in both a stable physiologic, as well as in an inflammatory environment. STUDY DESIGN: In vitro study. METHODS: The ion release profile of the MoRe alloy was comprehensively evaluated in-vitro after prolonged immersion in physiologic and inflammatory environments. Ion concentration analyses were then conducted using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) methods. Comparative testing of titanium (Ti-6Al-4V) and cobalt chromium (Co-28Cr-6Mo) was also performed. RESULTS: Under baseline physiologic conditions, the MoRe alloy demonstrates very low molybdenum and rhenium ion release rates throughout the 30-day test period. During the first time interval (day 0–1), low levels of molybdenum and rhenium ions are detected (<0.3 μg/cm2 day) followed by a rapid reduction in the ion release rates to <0.05 μg/cm2 day during the second time interval (days 1–3) followed by a further reduction to very low steady-state rates <0.01 μg/cm2 day during the third time interval (days 3–7), which were maintained through 30 days. In the inflammatory condition (H2O2 solution), there was a transient increase in the release of molybdenum and rhenium ions, followed by a return to baseline ion release rates (days 2–4), with a further reduction to low steady-state rates of ∼0.01 μg/cm2 day (days 4–8). The measured molybdenum and rhenium ion release rates in both steady state (<0.01 μg/cm2 day), and inflammatory environments (0.01 μg/cm2 day) were far below the established FDA-permitted daily exposure (PDE) of 1,900 μg/cm2 day for molybdenum and 4,400 μg/cm2 day for rhenium. In contrast, titanium and cobalt chromium approached or exceeded their established PDE values in an inflammatory environment. CONCLUSIONS: The novel biomaterial MoRe demonstrated a lower metal ion release profile in both a physiologic and inflammatory environment and was well below the established PDE. Comparative testing of the cobalt-chromium and titanium alloys found higher levels of ion release in the inflammatory environment that exceeded the PDE for cobalt and vanadium. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

Biomaterials fabricated from SAs (human SA, bovine SA, and ovalbumin) exhibit proper microstructure and hydrophilicity as well as remarkable biocompatibility; this makes them ideal for use in bone regeneration. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the structure, physicochemical properties, and biological features of SAs. SAs can be used to generate a wide array of biomaterials for bone repair because of their flexible structure and diverse functions, which enables us to control structure and morphology as well as modulate the biological responses with host tissue.

	abstract = {While most metal-based nanomaterials lack regulatory approval for clinical applications in pharmacology, the FDA-approved Feraheme (ferumoxytol) has been among the few exceptions. Further, the approval of several iron nanoparticles (NPs) in nanotherapeutics has inspired the need to develop a new immunoprotective biomaterial (BM) involving superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs. This article emphasizes the impact of superparamagnetic NPs on porphyrins in the capacity of intensifying their biological activities under biocompatible conditions. To explore the cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT) and post-PDT anti-inflammatory and immunoprotective significance in developing BMs as anti-cancer drugs, the photobiological significance of a hydrophilic BM of superparamagnetic Fe3O4 NP functionalized with a tri-pyridyl porphyrin photosensitizer (PS) through a flexible 4-phenylaminoacetic acid linker is investigated. Fluorescence confocal microscopy with spectral imaging indicated high uptake of the BM Fe3O4 NP-porphyrin (C-NP) in the human gastric cancer (AGS) cell line. The potential of the synthesized BM to promote apoptosis through the upregulation of p21 expression and sub-G0-G1 phase arrest of the cell cycle has been reported. Under PDT conditions, higher apoptosis rates were obtained by C-NP than its free base precursor C. The Fe3O4 NPs have been found to influence the porphyrin PS by enhancing their anti-inflammatory properties apparently by reducing nitric oxide (under light irradiation and in the dark), myeloperoxidase, and superoxide production in murine macrophages.

	abstract = {The oral and craniofacial region consists of various types of hard and soft tissues with the intricate organization. With the high prevalence of tissue defects in this specific region, it is highly desirable to enhance tissue regeneration through the development and use of engineered biomaterials. Collagen, the major component of tissue extracellular matrix, has come into the limelight in regenerative medicine. Although collagen has been widely used as an essential component in biomaterial engineering owing to its low immunogenicity, high biocompatibility, and convenient extraction procedures, there is a limited number of reviews on this specific clinic sector. The need for mechanical enhancement and functional engineering drives intensive efforts in collagen-based biomaterials concentrating on therapeutical outcomes and clinical translation in oral and craniofacial tissue regeneration. Herein, we highlighted the status quo of the design and applications of collagen-based biomaterials in oral and craniofacial tissue reconstruction. The discussion expanded on the inspiration from the leather tanning process on modifications of collagen-based biomaterials and the prospects of multi-tissue reconstruction in this particular dynamic microenvironment. The existing findings will lay a new foundation for the optimization of current collagen-based biomaterials for rebuilding oral and craniofacial tissues in the future.

Simultaneously, efforts are being undertaken to strengthen the scaffolding to improve cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue formation. Muscle cells proliferate and differentiate according to the directional patterns of the scaffold, similar to natural tissue and native muscle tissue. Therefore, establishing an aligned pattern in the scaffolding architecture is vital for cultured meat applications. Recent studies on the fabrication of scaffolds with aligned porosity structures and their utility in manufacturing cultured meat are highlighted in this review. In addition, the directional growth of muscle cells in terms of proliferation and differentiation has also been explored, along with the aligned scaffolding architectures. The aligned porosity architecture of the scaffolds supports the texture and quality of meat-like structures. Although it is difficult to build adequate scaffolds for culturing meat manufactured from diverse biopolymers, it is necessary to develop novel methods to create aligned scaffolding structures. Furthermore, to avoid animal slaughter in the future, it will be imperative to adopt non-animal-based biomaterials, growth factors, and serum-free media conditions for quality meat production. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Biomimetic materials have emerged as attractive and competitive alternatives for tissue engineering (TE) and regenerative medicine. In contrast to conventional biomaterials or synthetic materials, biomimetic scaffolds based on natural biomaterial can offer cells a broad spectrum of biochemical and biophysical cues that mimic the in vivo extracellular matrix (ECM). Additionally, such materials have mechanical adaptability, microstructure interconnectivity, and inherent bioactivity, making them ideal for the design of living implants for specific applications in TE and regenerative medicine. This paper provides an overview for recent progress of biomimetic natural biomaterials (BNBMs), including advances in their preparation, functionality, potential applications and future challenges. We highlight recent advances in the fabrication of BNBMs and outline general strategies for functionalizing and tailoring the BNBMs with various biological and physicochemical characteristics of native ECM. Moreover, we offer an overview of recent key advances in the functionalization and applications of versatile BNBMs for TE applications. Finally, we conclude by offering our perspective on open challenges and future developments in this rapidly-evolving field. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH), a progressive pathological process of femoral head ischemia and osteocyte necrosis, is a refractory orthopedic disease caused by multiple etiologies and there is no complete cure at present. With the extension of ONFH duration, osteocyte apoptosis and trabecular bone loss can decrease the load-bearing capacity of the femoral head, which leads to the collapse of the articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Therefore, an urgent clinical need exists to develop effective treatment strategies of early-stage ONFH for maintaining the hip joint function and preventing femoral head collapse. In recent years, extensive attention has been paid to the application of diverse biomaterials in treating early ONFH for sustaining the normal morphology and function of the autologous femoral head, and slowing disease progression. Herein, we review the research progress of bone grafts, metallic materials, bioceramics, bioglasses and polymer materials for early ONFH treatment, and discuss the biological mechanisms of bone repair and regeneration in the femoral-head necrotic area. We propose suggestions for future research directions, from a special perspective of improving the local microenvironment in femoral head by facilitating vessel-associated osteoclasts (VAOs) generation and coupling of bone-specific angiogenesis and osteogenesis, as well as inhibiting bone-associated osteoclasts (BAOs) and BAO-mediated bone resorption. This review can provide ideas for the research, development, and clinical application of biomaterials for treating early ONFH. Statement of significance: We believe that at least three aspects of this manuscript make it interesting to readers of the Acta Biomaterialia. First, we briefly summarize the incidence, pathogenesis, risk factors, classification criteria and treatment of early osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). Second, we review the research progress in biomaterials for early ONFH treatment and the biological mechanisms of bone repair and regeneration in femoral-head necrotic area. Third, we propose future research progress on improving the local microenvironment in femoral head by facilitating vessel-associated osteoclasts generation and coupling of bone-specific angiogenesis and osteogenesis, as well as inhibiting bone-associated osteoclasts and bone resorption. We hope this review can provide ideas for the research, development, and clinical application of biomaterials for treating early ONFH. © 2023 Acta Materialia Inc.},

	abstract = {Processing biomaterials into porous scaffolds for bone tissue engineering is a critical and a key step in defining and controlling their physicochemical, mechanical, and biological properties. Biomaterials such as polymers are commonly processed into porous scaffolds using conventional processing techniques, e.g., salt leaching. However, these traditional techniques have shown unavoidable limitations and several shortcomings. For instance, tissue-engineered porous scaffolds with a complex three-dimensional (3D) geometric architecture mimicking the complexity of the extracellular matrix of native tissues and with the ability to fit into irregular tissue defects cannot be produced using the conventional processing techniques. 3D printing has recently emerged as an advanced processing technology that enables the processing of biomaterials into 3D porous scaffolds with highly complex architectures and tunable shapes to precisely fit into irregular and complex tissue defects. 3D printing provides computer-based layer-by-layer additive manufacturing processes of highly precise and complex 3D structures with well-defined porosity and controlled mechanical properties in a highly reproducible manner. Furthermore, 3D printing technology provides an accurate patient-specific tissue defect model and enables the fabrication of a patient-specific tissue-engineered porous scaffold with pre-customized properties. © 2023, Higher Education Press.},

	abstract = {As a highly specialized shock-absorbing connective tissue, articular cartilage (AC) has very limited self-repair capacity after traumatic injuries, posing a heavy socioeconomic burden. Common clinical therapies for small- to medium-size focal AC defects are well-developed endogenous repair and cell-based strategies, including microfracture, mosaicplasty, autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), and matrix-induced ACI (MACI). However, these treatments frequently result in mechanically inferior fibrocartilage, low cost-effectiveness, donor site morbidity, and short-term durability. It prompts an urgent need for innovative approaches to pattern a pro-regenerative microenvironment and yield hyaline-like cartilage with similar biomechanical and biochemical properties as healthy native AC. Acellular regenerative biomaterials can create a favorable local environment for AC repair without causing relevant regulatory and scientific concerns from cell-based treatments. A deeper understanding of the mechanism of endogenous cartilage healing is furthering the (bio)design and application of these scaffolds. Currently, the utilization of regenerative biomaterials to magnify the repairing effect of joint-resident endogenous stem/progenitor cells (ESPCs) presents an evolving improvement for cartilage repair. This review starts by briefly summarizing the current understanding of endogenous AC repair and the vital roles of ESPCs and chemoattractants for cartilage regeneration. Then several intrinsic hurdles for regenerative biomaterials-based AC repair are discussed. The recent advances in novel (bio)design and application regarding regenerative biomaterials with favorable biochemical cues to provide an instructive extracellular microenvironment and to guide the ESPCs (e.g. adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation, matrix production, and remodeling) for cartilage repair are summarized. Finally, this review outlines the future directions of engineering the next-generation regenerative biomaterials toward ultimate clinical translation. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Small-diameter vascular grafts frequently fail because of obstruction and infection. Despite the wide range of commercially available vascular grafts, the anatomical uniqueness of defect sites demands patient-specific designs. This study aims to increase the success rate of implantation by fabricating bilayer vascular grafts containing bioactive glasses (BGs) and modifying their composition by removing hemostatic ions to make them blood-compatible and to enhance their antibacterial and angiogenesis properties. The porous vascular graft tubes were 3D printed using polycaprolactone, polyglycerol sebacate, and the modified BGs. The polycaprolactone sheath was then wrapped around the 3D-printed layer using the electrospinning technique to prevent blood leakage. The results demonstrated that the incorporation of modified BGs into the polymeric matrix not only improved the mechanical properties of the vascular graft but also significantly enhanced its antibacterial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive strains. In addition, no hemolysis or platelet activity was detected after incorporating modified BGs into the vascular grafts. Copper-releasing vascular grafts significantly enhanced endothelial cell proliferation, motility, and VEGF secretion. Additionally, In vivo angiogenesis (CD31 immunofluorescent staining) and gene expression experiments showed that copper-releasing vascular grafts considerably promoted the formation of new blood vessels, low-grade inflammation (decreased expression of IL-1β and TNF-α), and high-level angiogenesis (increased expression of angiogenic growth factors including VEGF, PDGF-BB, and HEBGF). These observations indicate that the use of BGs with suitable compositional modifications in vascular grafts may promote the clinical success of patient-specific vascular prostheses by accelerating tissue regeneration without any coagulation problems. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Numerous biomaterials have been developed over the years to enhance the outcomes of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. These products are specifically designed to prevent postoperative bleeding, optimize wound healing, and reduce inflammation. However, there is no singular material on the market that can be deemed the optimal material for the nasal pack. We systematically reviewed the available evidence to assess the functional biomaterial efficacy after ESS in prospective studies. The search was performed using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 31 articles were identified in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) was used to assess each study’s risk of bias. The studies were critically analyzed and categorized into types of biomaterial and functional properties, according to synthesis without meta-analysis (SWiM) guidelines. Despite the heterogeneity between studies, it was observed that chitosan, gelatin, hyaluronic acid, and starch-derived materials exhibit better endoscopic scores and significant potential for use in nasal packing. The published data support the idea that applying a nasal pack after ESS improves wound healing and patient-reported outcomes. © 2023 by the authors.},
